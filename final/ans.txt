the whole body like malaria disable the immune system and prevent it from detecting and fighting other microorganisms the australian and german researchers say the discovery may help scientists to develop vaccines that restore immunity in people with systemic or whole body infections they publish their research today online in the journal nature immunology the immune response is alerted when specialised sentries of the immune system dendritic cells detect a virus or bacteria they alert the immune system by capturing infected cells and displaying fragments or antigens of the pathogen on their surface in a process called crosspresentation lead researcher dr jose villadangos an immunologist from the walter and eliza institute of medical research in melbourne says systemic infections such as malaria or sepsis a bacterial infection of the blood overstimulate dendritic cells this results in the immune systems critical alarm system shutting down this doesnt occur in local infections because only a few dendritic cells are involved villadangos says but in the case of malaria infections and sepsis dendritic cells throughout the body are concentrated on alerting the immune system which prevents them from detecting and responding to any new infections a new type of vaccine villadangos and colleagues managed to restore immunity in mice with an immune system compromised by sepsis they injected them with a live vaccine made of dendritic cells that had been exposed to a secondary virus in the laboratory and subsequently displayed antigens of that virus villadangos says the findings show the missing link in the immunosupressed animal is the capacity of the dendritic cells to display the antigens of new viruses we should be able to take dendritic cells from a patient with sepsis or malaria and expose them to antigens of the virus of a secondary infection and inject them back into the patient this strategy is already being used in the development of anticancer vaccines we are yet to find out if will work against secondary infections in humans with a systemic infection villadangos says scientists will analyse the contents of this capsule for clues about how the solar system began a sevenyear quest to return to earth pristine samples from the solar systems formation ended in triumph in a dark and wet utah desert at the weekend its hard to describe what it feels like to be at this point of the mission university of washington researcher and lead scientist of the stardust mission professor don brownlee said shortly after the probes touchdown at utc aedt on sunday we travelled almost billion miles in space we visited a comet grabbed a piece of it and it landed here this morning brownlee said its an incredible thrill stardust released its precious cargo during a highspeed flyby of earth sending the tyresized canister soaring through space at a blazing speed of about kilometres per hour when it smashed into the planets atmosphere this makes it the fastest humanmade object topping the record set in may by the returning apollo command module as its heatshield fried away a cometlike plume formed in its wake looking like a torch that was visible in parts of the western us we werent quite sure how bright it was going to be and some people didnt think we would see anything says brownlee who slipped outside the utah base with some of his team members to try to spot the capsules streak across the sky after scanning the sky for several minutes brownlee finally found an object that he said looked like mars but was clearly not where mars was at the time it was twinkling a little bit getting a little brighter and moving i thought maybe thats a helicopter but it kept getting brighter and brighter and brighter he says the object was reddish in colour and trailed a bright glowing plume behind it brownlee says its ironic you have a comet mission that ends producing a comet collecting spacedust during its time in space stardust passed by comet wild vilt and extended a gelfilled collecting device to trap some particles to take back to earth it also collected bits of interstellar dust scientists believe comets contain unaltered material that was used to form the solar system we did this mission to collect the most primitive materials we could in the solar system brownlee says we went to a comet that formed at the edge of the solar system far from the sun under very cold conditions were confident that it was made out of the initial building blocks of our solar system the capsule was retrieved by helicopter crews and taken to a clean room on the utah test and training range for inspection the canister containing the samples is scheduled to be removed from the capsule and flown to the nasa space center in houston on tuesday there scientists will catalogue the samples and begin distributing them to teams for analysis gotcha a colourful striking image can spark your interest internet users can take just onetwentieth of a second to decide whether they like the look of a website new research has found visual appeal can be assessed within milliseconds suggesting that web designers have about milliseconds to make a good impression the canadian researchers report in the marchapril issue of the journal behaviour information technology dr gitte lindgaard and colleagues from carleton university in ottawa confirm that internet users are a fickle lot the team did this by flashing up websites for milliseconds and asking participants to rate them for visual appeal when they repeated the exercise after a longer viewing period the ratings were consistent the medium is the message the finding comes as bad news to anyone hoping to convey information says sue burgess an australian researcher who evaluates website useability and senior lecturer in information management at the university of technology sydney theres no doubt that people do respond very quickly to websites and decide very quickly whether to stay on them she says the appeal of a website is usually tied to colour movement and interactivity she says with the way the information is structured coming second burgess says its unclear whether the internet is changing our ability to concentrate for long periods our if we are adapting to the medium theres so much information and theres always going to be a lot of clicking around just to see whats there she says the halo effect australian associate professor of psychology bill von hippel from the university of new south wales says it takes about milliseconds to read one word making this a stunningly remarkable timeframe in which to process the complex stimuli on a website its quite remarkable that people do it that fast and that it holds up in their later judgement he says this may be because we have an affective or emotional system that works independently of our cognitive system in evolutionary terms this ability helped us respond rapidly to dangerous situations he says the study also reflects the socalled halo effect von hippel says where an initial bias towards something drives subsequent judgements this suggests that we make very quick judgements based on some sort of emotional reaction and our more considered judgements still reflect that first impression jewish peoples history and migrations are reflected in their dna a new study shows four jewish mothers who lived years ago in europe are the ancestors of of all ashkenazi jews alive today international researchers report the dna study paints a vivid picture of human evolution and survival and correlates with the wellestablished written and oral histories of jewish migrations says dr doron behar of the technionisrael institute of technology who worked on the study the study published in the american journal of human genetics suggests that some million jews alive today descended from four women for their study behar and scientists from europe and the us sampled dna from people from populations all subjects reported the birthplace of their mothers grandmothers and in most cases greatgrandmothers the scientists write they looked at mitochondrial dna which is found in cells outside the nucleus and away from the dna that carries most genetic instructions mitochondrial dna is passed down virtually unchanged from mother to daughter but it does occasionally mutate at a known rate researchers can use this molecular clock to track genetic changes through time they used it for instance to compute when the ancestral eve of all living humans lived in africa about years ago now they have found four ancestral jewish mothers i think there was some kind of genetic pool that was in the near east behar says among this genetic pool there were four maternal lineages four real women that carried the exact specific mitochondrial dna markers that we can find in mitochondrial dna today settling europe they or their direct descendants moved into europe then at a certain period most probably in the th century simply by demographic matters they started to expand dramatically behar says maybe it was because of jewish tradition the structure of the family that might have been characterised by a high number of children but these four families gave rise to much of the population of european jews which exploded from people in the th century to something like million just prior to world war ii behar says the nazis and their allies killed million jews during the war but there are now an estimated million ashkenazi jews defined by their common northern and central european ancestry cultural traditions and yiddish language behar says as they sampled people from ashkenazi communities around the world the same mitochondrial genetic markers kept popping up they did not find the markers in most of the nonjewish people they sampled and only a very few were shared with jews of other origin ancestry not genetic disease this particular study does not provide a direct explanation for some of the inherited diseases that disproportionately affect jews of european descent such as breast and colon cancer because most diseases are caused by mutations in nuclear dna not the dna studied by behars group these genes are believed to date from a bottleneck phenomenon when populations were squeezed down from large to small and then expanded again behar and skoreckis team have found what is known as a founder effect when one or a small number of people have a huge number of descendants scientists hope to gain an insight into the secret life of clouds with australias biggest climate experiment international storm chasers gathering in australia this week will release more than weather balloons over the next month as part of the nations largest meteorological study the tropical warm pool international cloud experiment based in darwin will provide the worlds most comprehensive set of data about the behaviour of thunderclouds says dr peter may a principal research scientist at the australian bureau of meteorology in melbourne may says the study will give scientists better ways of modelling cloud behaviour resulting in more accurate shortterm weather forecasting and better predictions for longterm climate change the biggest uncertainty in climate forecasts and greenhouse calculations comes down to our understanding of thunderstorms he says the underlying aim of this experiment is to increase our understanding of thunderstorms themselves how they evolve and the large scale impact they have collaborators in the project include the bureau the us department of energy atmospheric radiation measurement program the csiro nasa and universities from australia the us europe canada and japan measuring ice crystals may says the tropical weather conditions in darwin which was devastated by cyclone tracy in provide a natural laboratory for storm watchers and this is the time of year for tropical storms when darwin has its monsoonlike wet season the multimillion dollar study will have three prongs may says research planes will fly directly into the clouds to measure ice crystals while a groundbased network will use radars laser and infrared systems to look at cloud characteristics and the movement of heat moisture and light and weather balloons will be released every three hours over days from five sites around darwin this data set is going to be a real resource for the whole meteorological community may says itll be the data set that people go to develop new model systems for the next years there will be dozens if not hundreds of papers written about this experiment may says the link between climate change and global storm patterns is unclear but he says its unlikely that climate change is directly responsible for isolated events like hurricane katrina that struck new orleans last year the question isnt is a particular storm due to climate change the question is are we loading the dice so that we can expect more storms or will they be more intense he says artists think pluto looks like this but we wont know for certain until nasas new horizons spacecraft due to launch this week reaches the distant planet in about a decade the us space agency is set to shed light on pluto with the launch of the new horizons spacecraft this week the spacecraft which is due to be launched at aedt on wednesday utc tuesday will also investigate a new class of planetlike objects called ice dwarfs that exist beyond the orbit of neptune over the decades nasa has launched probe after probe for closeup studies of earths sister planets but distant pluto has remained shrouded in mystery with only a few fuzzy telescope pictures for scientists to ponder what we know about pluto today could fit on the back of postage stamp says dr colleen hartman nasas deputy associate administrator for science and new horizons principal investigator dr alan stern with the southwest research institute in boulder colorado agrees we have much to learn about the history of these distant objects these are objects that were growing to planethood but something stopped that process of growth midgestation he says it left us these fossil relics pluto is the largest and bestknown object in the kuiper belt region of the solar system like comets the planetary bodies in the kuiper belt region are so far from the sun that scientists believe they still contain some of the original material that was used to form the solar system how the universe formed new horizons is a u million a million attempt to learn more about how the universe formed the pianosized spacecraft contains seven science instruments to map pluto its largest moon charon and two other recently discovered smaller moons as well as other kuiper belt objects to shave as much time as possible from the journey to pluto which will take more than nine years nasa is launching new horizons aboard a massive rocket typically used for communications satellites five to times heftier than the halftonne science probe the launch vehicle an atlas rocket with two upperstage motors and an unprecedented five solidrocket strapon boosters for extra punch has successfully flown six previous missions the rocket was rolled out from its hangar to its cape canaveral launch pad earlier this week even with the kilometre per hour boost into space new horizons will still need to bounce off jupiters massive gravity field and travel for nearly a decade to reach pluto hitching a ride if the probe cannot be launched by feburary it will miss the opportunity to slingshot off jupiter and take an additional three to five years to reach pluto depending on the actual launch date scientists who already have waited decades for nasa to approve and fund a mission to pluto are happy to at last be on their way this is a place where nature operates at vastly different temperatures and conditions than were familiar with on earth says new horizons coinvestigator professor richard binzel with the massachusetts institute of technology were poised to begin the exploration of a new world adds dr dale cruikshank with the nasa ames research center in california backpackers form a highly mobile community says a researcher whos developing a new communication device especially for them backpackers may one day use a mobile travel assistant to ring home and network with other travellers while finding out the cost of a bus ticket to bondi beach an australian researcher says the digital travel buddy would also act as a travel guide with information about the best places to go and how to get there says jeff axup a phd student at the university of queensland and former backpacker axup has been studying backpacker culture and communication as part of his research into the technology needs of socalled mobile communities a lot of research focuses too much on the technology and tries to find an application he says we like to look at how people naturally act and try to come up with technology to fit their needs in a recent study axup shadowed a group of backpackers and documented their behaviour as they toured brisbane took a boat cruise and visited an animal park the results of his study are published on the eprintsuq website and will be submitted for publication in coming weeks axups latest research includes prototypes of the technology which is being developed with the australasian crc for interaction design the final product will probably be softwarebased so backpackers can download it onto their mobile phones he says and it will be likely to include instant messaging and discussion forums or use wireless technology mobile communities axup says backpackers are cultural symbols of an increasingly mobile world a change brought about by improved transport and technology and the breakdown of the traditional neighbourhood one term to describe this is glocalisation where you still have your local communities but theyve gone global and they may be distributed he says backpackers already use mobile phones text messaging and the internet but axups research shows that they are driving changes in technology as much as the technology is changing the nature of travel any time you introduce new technology it always enters an existing social and technological environment so it will of course change the existing environment he says but then people will take it and use it in ways that were never expected and maybe even change the technology watching a comedy is as good for the heart as aerobic exercise new research suggests watching a comedy film boosts the flow of blood to the heart but watching a sad film makes the flow decline a us study shows university of maryland researchers asked young people to watch movie segments lasting to minutes taken from comedy films and serious films with at least hours between the two sessions with the help of ultrasound the researchers measured the study participants blood flow through the brachial artery this vessel runs between the shoulder to the elbow and its blood flow is thought to be a good indicator of blood flow around the body blood flow was reduced in of the volunteers when they watched extracts such as the distressful opening scenes to saving private ryan but blood flow rose in out of when they watched funny clips such as scenes from something about mary the difference between the two flows was more than according to the study which appears today in the journal heart watching a sad movie has about the same effect on heart flow as remembering an angry incident or doing mental arithmetic it says but watching a comedy is equivalent to a bout of aerobic exercise or starting a course of cholesterolbusting statin drugs depression anxiety hostility and anger are already known to impair nitric oxide pathways that help blood vessels to dilate the authors tentatively suggest that a chuckle may stimulate selected hormones to have the opposite effect positive emotions such as mirthful laughter may have a beneficial effect on the endothelium the cells that line the walls of the blood circulation system they speculate why did the turtle cross the road because it wanted lunch scientists are studying the wandering ways of australias eastern longnecked turtle to see if can learn to cross the road professor arthur georges director of the applied ecology research group at the university of canberra says its the first time researchers have documented how roads affect the turtles georges says unlike other turtles chelodina longicollis has evolved the ability to take long overland hikes because it prefers ephemeral waters such as temporary swamps and pools when a wetland dries the nutrients are released from the sediment and when it refills theres a flush of production so theyre capitalising on all the insects and other foods that benefit from that flush he says the hardy creatures gravitate to permanent waters in a drought where they can switch off growth and reproduction sometimes for as long as seven years they then hit the road as soon as the rains come georges and his team are studying a population of turtles in jervis bay in southern new south wales and hope to have some results ready for publication in the middle of the year look right look left look right again georges says the longnecked turtle is familiar with its environment and may even have learnt to avoid roads what we have found is that they use the sun and an internal clock to navigate and they know landscape really well so they tend to beeline to various places he says were going to take them from the wetlands and release them near a road and observe their behaviour as they approach the road they may have an aversion to it and turn around but if the road safety message hasnt sunk in it may be necessary to build tunnels under roads to provide them with safe passage he says while it appears that some aspects of development have got in the way of the turtles natural behaviour it hasnt been all bad for the longnecked turtle georges says when you fly over surrounding farmland youll see there are lots of dams he says each one is full of about turtles and those sorts of water bodies werent there before he says but on the downside when a road runs through a wetland you can increase the chance that over time the population will decline landslides like this one in pakistan earlier this week may become more common if climate change increases rainfall scientists say heavier rainfall as a result of climate change could loosen soils making landslides more common un experts say this may risk hillside slums in latin america to antiquities in egypts valley of the kings according to scientists meeting in tokyo this week to discuss ways to prevent and ease damage from landslides if climate change predictions are accurate you will expect more intense and extreme rainfalls says professor srikantha herath senior academic officer of the un university a report released at the time of the meeting says some cultural sites are at risk from landslides including the valley of the kings where egypts pharaohs are buried the inca mountain fortress of machu picchu in peru and chinas huaqing palace dating from the tang dynasty special attention should be given to cultural and natural heritage sites of universal and irreplaceable values says professor kyoji sassa director of the disaster prevention research institute at japans kyoto university in some places particularly in developing countries the natural threats are being exacerbated by rapid tourism development he says early warning herath says the tokyo talks are likely to call for better monitoring and early warning systems special protection of cultural sites better preparedness and quick aid for victims he says it is impossible to say if global warming is already causing more landslides of natural disasters landslides are the seventh biggest killer behind droughts storms floods earthquakes volcanoes and extreme temperatures according to the report for the un university kyoto university and unesco among severe landslides about died in cholima in honduras in and almost in northern italy in the louvain university database on which the figures are based often excludes landslides triggered by earthquakes unstable hillsides in many poor nations many people were forced to live on unstable hillsides away from flat plains exploited for farming late arrivals are always settling in the most dangerous land says professor janos bogardi director of the un university institute for environment and human security he says that better building codes and simply giving out information about the risks of mudslides could save lives asia suffered most with landslides in the past century out of about that caused human deaths the scientists say many of the most deadly mudslides were in latin america and the costliest in europe about people died in landslides in each of the past years the un university says the wind may carry legionnaires bacteria from cooling towers much further than once thought scientists say the bacteria responsible for causing legionnaires disease can spread through the air up to kilometres from its source french researchers report legionella pneumophila likes to live in hot water such as in industrial cooling towers or the water systems of large buildings where it can then cause pneumonialike infections now a new study suggests that a wider area may be at risk past studies found airborne legionella spread only a few hundred metres says lead author dr tran minh nhu nguyen currently at the national public health institute in helsinki if other investigators confirm the new findings he says a number of regulations and guidelines related to this environmental health risk should be revised accordingly in the journal of infectious diseases nguyen and his team report on their investigation of a outbreak of legionnaires disease that occurred in pasdecalais in northern france they identify a contaminated cooling tower at a petrochemical plant as the source of the outbreak which killed of the people with laboratoryconfirmed infection most of the victims lived within kilometres of the plant although one lived kilometres away the fatality rate is striking when compared with past communityacquired outbreaks in which fatality rates were to the researchers note they think the strain of legionella involved could have been unusually virulent the outbreak occurred in two peaks the first ending after the cooling tower had been shut down and the second beginning during cleaning of the tower and peaking once it had reopened the pattern suggests that highpressure cleaning methods used to decontaminate the towers contributed to the bacterias spread there are measures and guidelines for managing cooling towers contaminated with legionella nguyen says however how well they have been adopted and implemented depends on the individual country and setting map collector liu gang speaks in beijing in front of a slide of a map which is said to be an th century copy of the original and showing the americas in unusual detail a chinese map collector has found a copy of an ancient map he claims proves controversial theories that a famed chinese mariner was the first to sail to the americas and circumnavigate the world liu gang says the map supports recent theories that chinese people sailed to america before christopher columbus and charted parts of the world such as antartica and northern canada long before western explorers the map shows us that chinese discovered the world years before columbus liu said in a public unveiling of the chart the map tells us that mariner zheng he discovered the world the map is dated to but is also clearly marked that it is a copy of a map made in that date coincides with zheng hes voyages from to liu bought the map for about us a from a map collector in shanghai in but only realised its importance after he read gavin menzies bestselling book the year china discovered the world in the book menzies theorises that previously undiscovered world maps drawn up by zheng hes admirals were copied by european map makers and were extensively used during the voyages of great western explorers including columbus ferdinand magellan vasco da gama and james cook much of menzies theories are supported by his knowledge of ocean currents continental trade winds and star navigation that he learned during his life as a british naval commander despite its prominence on bestseller lists many historians have criticised menzies theories for the lack of accompanying evidence chinas ming dynasty banned oceangoing exploration and trade on pain of death after zheng hes final voyage largely due to the death of emperor zhu di who sponsored the voyages the huge costs of zhengs fleets which often numbered hundreds of ships were another factor the chinese records of zheng hes voyages have largely been lost either purposely destroyed as part of the ban on oceangoing navigation or due to a fire that ravaged beijings imperial palace in the s liu believes a lot of the records still exist but chinese scholars have largely ignored them i sincerely believe that other maps exist and books exist that contain evidence of zheng hes world travels but noone has been paying attention to them liu says it is my purpose to try to wake these scholars up the new fridge magnets will be aware of others on the fridge and communicate with them fridge magnets may one day be able to fix bad grammar and change the words to something they think is more appropriate the idea is that each magnet is aware of the other magnets on the fridge and they transmit information between each other says australian digital artist pierre proske proske is working with researchers at the future applications lab of the viktoria institute in sweden to develop the intelligent fridge magnets details will be presented at the international conference on intelligent user interfaces in sydney later this month each fridge magnet consists of character liquid crystal display rather than a magnetic strip with a printed word proske says the magnets can randomly generate a word categorise that word as a noun verb adjective or adverb and transmit the category to any words they are placed next to as you compose a poem placing words in grammatical order the magnets communicate with each other to learn the grammar rules you are using once they are trained the magnets can change the words they are displaying to substitute words that dont fit the established grammar rules like an autocorrect function so the actual word thats associated with each magnet can change depending on the way in which its aligned says proske reshuffling gives you a new word luckily if you dont like the word the magnet substitutes you can always take the magnet off the fridge and shake it to reshuffle and get a new word and the plan is for you to be able to reset the magnets completely so they forget all their grammar rules of course the magnets rely on being taught good grammar in the first place someone could instil bad grammar if they wanted to says proske but he doesnt want to take all the fun for those kitchenbased partygoers that like making up crazy sentences on fridges he says the system will only worry about which words can be immediately next to each other and wont be too strict about the grammar of the sentence as a whole this was deliberate to keep the sentences a little more poetic says proske the idea is it is still fridge poetry we dont want to create sentences that make total sense changing words to fit themes the team also hopes that the magnets will be able to substitute words in response to stimuli other than bad grammar for example someone might have a set of magnets on the home fridge and a set of magnets on the work fridge that can communicate via wireless internet says proske if the magnets at home read for example crazy kangaroos dream wildly those at work might change to drunk wallabies laze around the pool in keeping with the australian theme the team also suggest it might be interesting to apply their ideas to scrabble and crosswords but says further details on this are a subject for further investigation proske and colleagues have so far half developed a prototype intelligent fridge poetry magnet system and are hoping to get more ideas at the sydney conference and theyre not just interested in generating another product for the consumer market this is a whimsical and accessible way to contribute to the study of developing intelligent robots says proske the findings could explain the traditional job of men as societys enforcers say researchers men are likely to take pleasure when they see someone punished for acting unfairly while women are likely to feel badly for the culprit say neuroscientists dr tania singer of university college london and team report their findings today online ahead of print publication in the journal nature in a twophase experiment the researchers recruited male and female volunteers as well as four others who were undercover actors hired to play the role of volunteers in the first part of the experiment the group played a game of mutual investment in which they had to give money to one of their number the recipient decided how much to give back from the profits they could hand back up to triple the investment at little reward to themselves or hand back little or nothing maximising their own gains at the investors cost one actor was cast in a generous role always giving lots of money back to their partners while another actor was cast as a meanie giving back very little and sometimes nothing at all body language by the volunteers confirmed later in questionnaires confirmed that they did not like the actors who had cheated on them fair players in contrast were rated as more agreeable more likeable and remarkably more attractive brain imaging reveals sex differences in the second phase the same volunteers were each placed in a magnetic resonance imaging scanner a device which shows blood flows within the brain the volunteer was then given a demonstration of a mild shock the equivalent of short beesting and then watched as the actors standing next to the scanner got the same painful treatment when a fair actor received a shock the scanner showed empathy among all the volunteers in males and females alike the images showed activation of the anterior insulafrontoinsular cortex aifi and anterior cingulate cortex acc previous research has showed that these parts of the brain cause the feeling of distress when one sees someone else in pain when an unfair actor got a shock the aifi and acc lit up again among most female volunteers but amongst the men these empathic areas showed no increase in activity reward centre activated in men men who watched unfair actors suffering did show an activation of their nucleus accumbens the part of the brain associated with the satisfaction of reward this activation was not seen in most female volunteers singer says the results show that fairness in social situations shapes the nature of the emotional link we have to other people we empathise with others if they cooperate and act fairly but in contrast selfish and unfair behaviour compromises this empathic link she says singer believes these fundamental responses at the individual level have played a key role in social evolution they would explain for instance why communities everywhere draw up laws or codes to punish or sideline those who cheat and freeload on the majority she says as for the gender difference about punishing a social offender singer says she could not rule out the possibility that the experiment favoured men as there was a physical rather than psychological or financial threat involved despite this limitation she says the results could explain the traditional job of men as societys enforcers this investigation would seem to indicate there is a predominant role for men in maintaining justice and issuing punishment she says remote peoples can describe and understand geometrical concepts related to circles triangles and parallel lines scientists show so is geometry hardwired in the brain amazonian huntergatherers who lack written language and who have never seen a maths book do well on basic geometry tests researchers say in a study that suggests geometry may be hardwired into the brain adults and children alike showed a clear grasp of concepts such as where the centre of a circle is and the logical extension of a straight line this was despite not having words for these concepts the researchers report today in the journal science professor stanislas dehaene of the college de france in paris and colleagues tested children and adults of an amazonian group called the munduruku and compared their findings to tests of us adults and children munduruku children and adults spontaneously made use of basic geometric concepts such as points lines parallelism or right angles to detect intruders in simple pictures and they used distance angle and sense relationships in geometrical maps to locate hidden objects they write our results provide evidence for geometrical intuitions in the absence of schooling experience with graphic symbols or maps or a rich language of geometrical terms geometry is an ancient field and dehaenes team postulated that it may spring from innate abilities many of its propositions that two points determine a line or that three orthogonal axes localize a point are judged to be selfevident and yet have been questioned on the basis of logical argument physical theory or experiment the researchers write there was no way the munduruku could have learned these ideas they add most of the children and adults who took part in our experiments inhabit scattered isolated villages and have little or no schooling rulers compasses or maps they write furthermore the munduruku language has few words dedicated to arithmetical geometrical or spatial concepts although a variety of metaphors are spontaneously used playing by the rules they designed arrays of six images each of which contained five conforming to a geometric concept and one that violated it the participants were asked in their language to point to the weird or ugly one the researchers write all participants even those aged performed well above the chance level of the average score was nearly correct identical to the score for us children the spontaneous understanding of geometrical concepts and maps by this remote human community provides evidence that core geometrical knowledge like basic arithmetic is a universal constituent of the human mind they conclude soil harbours bacteria that contain antibiotic resistance genes so is this where hospital superbugs get their protective genes from bacteria in dirt may be born with a resistance to antibiotics which could help shed light on the problem of drugdefying superbugs canadian researchers say they tested hundreds of different bacteria found in soil and discovered that every one had some resistance to antibiotics meaning they had evolved a mechanism for evading the effects of the drugs the findings published today in the journal science could help to explain why bacteria so quickly develop resistance to antibiotics and why drug companies must constantly develop new ones it explains where these things come from in the first place says dr gerry wright of ontarios mcmaster university this work could prove to be extremely valuable to the drug development process wrights team dug up strains of streptomyces bacteria and tested them for resistance to various antibiotics without exception every strain was found to be multidrug resistant to seven or eight antibiotics on average with two strains being resistant to of drugs the scientists write a logical place to start these particular bacteria do not infect people but wright believes the findings almost certainly apply to other species of microbes it turns out that streptomyces make lots of antibiotics wright says anything that ends in mycin comes from streptomycin vancomycin streptomycin that was why they chose this group of bacteria we were curious to see where these things might come from in the first place so it seemed that was a logical place to start i expect lots of these drugresistant genes are peppered all over the microbial community wright says the scientists exposed the bacteria to known antibiotics and then searched for genes that were activated when the microbes survived we found old mechanisms and new mechanisms wright says we found a brandnew resistance mechanism to an antibiotic called telithromycin he says referring to aventis drug ketek which has only recently been approved in some countries ketek was designed to overcome resistance to antibiotics but one of the bacteria wright tested evolved a way to prevent it from working developing resistance almost as soon as penicillin was introduced in the s bacteria began to develop resistance to its effects prompting researchers to develop many new generations of antibiotics but their overuse and misuse have helped fuel the rise of drugresistant superbugs the us centers for disease control and prevention says of infections that people get while in the hospital are resistant to at least one antibiotic wright says his findings do not get doctors off the hook he says they still must prescribe antibiotics only when they are needed and stress to patients the need to use them properly soil bacteria live in a constant kind of arms race making antibiotics to protect themselves against other bacteria and then evolving antibiotic resistance to evade the antibiotics made by other bacteria their coping tactics may be able to give us a glimpse into the future of clinical resistance to antibiotics wright says nanoparticles may rescue us from the drudgery of cleaning the bathroom cleaning bathrooms could become a chore of the past with new coatings on bench surfaces tiles and glass that do the job for you say australian researchers professor rose amal of the arc centre for functional nanomaterials and team are developing new coatings they hope will be useful for selfcleaning surfaces in homes and hospitals if you can have selfcleaning materials you can do the job properly without having to use disinfectants and other chemicals says amal based at the university of new south wales in sydney tiny particles of titanium dioxide up to nanometres in diameter are currently used on outdoor surfaces such as selfcleaning windows these titanium dioxide nanoparticles absorb uva light ultraviolet light below nanometres in wavelength this excites electrons and gives the particles an oxidising ability more powerful than chlorine bleach the nanoparticles can then kill microbes and break down organic compounds from vehicle and industrial emissions into carbon dioxide and water surfaces coated with the titanium dioxide nanoparticles also have another property called superhydrophilicity that helps them selfclean this is when water does not form droplets but rather runs straight off the surface washing as it goes changing the activating light but titanium dioxide can only be activated by uva and this is only present in sunlight not other sources of light like indoor light this means that to date selfcleaning coatings have been limited to outdoor surfaces amal and team have been modifying titanium dioxide nanoparticles so they can absorb light at higher wavelengths in the visible spectrum over nanometres in wavelength they have been doping titanium dioxide nanoparticles with a small amounts of other elements such as iron or nitrogen in place of titanium or oxygen lab trials show that glass coated with the new nanoparticles can be activated by visible light from a lamp to kill bacteria escherichia coli and degrade volatile organic compounds if you can coat it onto a shower room you dont have to clean the shower room that often says amal because of the oxidising properties fungus will also not grow on the surface outdoor coatings could benefit too while amal says the selfcleaning coatings would be useful on tiles glass screens and benches in bathrooms and hospitals she says the nanoparticles could also be used to improve outdoor selfcleaning surfaces uva only makes up of sunlight she says whereas the ability to use visible light would significantly increase the amount of sunlight that could be used if you use this material outdoors you can utilise more of the sunlight wavelengths she says funding so far has been through the australian research council but amal says her team will be looking for commercial support down the track she expects it will be another year before the nanoparticles will be ready for largescale production safety considerations amal says recent concerns about the toxicity of nanoparticles should not apply to those in the selfcleaning coatings because they are chemically glued to surfaces with polyethylene glycol and so are not free to float in the air for this particular application i dont think it should be a problem she says a long tailfin or sword scares off competitors and impresses the ladies colourful aquarium fish known as swordtails size up competitors tailfins before fighting us scientists show often a male just has to show his big elongated tail which looks like a pointy sword to scare off challengers according to a new study in the latest issue of the journal animal behaviour yet another study in the same publication concludes that female swordtails prefer male swordtails with big striped swords researchers even think the female fixation on these bright appendages led to their emergence in the first place since female fondness for novel traits and bright colours appears to have preceded the appearance of male swords the finding suggests the creation of some secondary sexual characteristics may be influenced and even controlled by the opposite sex for male swordtails this characteristic is an extension of the tail or caudal fin it is not terribly rigid and cannot be manipulated very efficiently says dr kari benson who coauthored the first paper with dr alexandra basolo it is not useful as a weapon it is only used as a visual signal in a fight benson a researcher at lynchburg college says the sword might signal many things how strong and vigorous he is how well he ate while growing up or simply by indicating that he is large the researchers staged duels between swordtails xiphophorus helleri by putting two comparably sized males with differentsized swords in a tank and then observing their interactions which usually involved aggressive behaviour such as chasing and biting the researchers then artificially manipulated sword size by affixing fake plastic swords to the fish repeatedly the male with the bigger sword won often all he had to do was to show his sword and then the other male slunk away basolo from the university of nebraska says the loser really looks the part his body darkens due to a stress response he puts his head down and he then positions himself at the periphery of the tank she says adding that the loser even folds in his fins dr brian trainor a researcher in the college of social and behavioral sciences at ohio state university says one part i was a bit amazed with was that in the sword manipulation experiment somehow the fish were able to determine their own artificial sword sizes i think people usually think that fish are not too bright not only were these swordtails able to assess their competitors apparent sword length but also they were able to compare that with their own sword length i thought that was a cool result he even believes there is a swordtailhuman link since both species seem to have evolved traits and behaviours that do not offer apparent survival benefits the sword for example appears to be useless save for its visual impact for humans he says possible examples include artistic abilities and senses of humour like male fish showing off their swords to females he suggested that these human abilities might exist in part to impress members of the opposite sex like the fish swords they can also weed out competitors who may not be as talented or humourous our studies in swordtails show that sexually selected traits can be complex and used in multiple behavioural contexts much like many aspects of human behaviour he says this hourglassshaped crater on mars provides more evidence that glaciers once carved the planets surface glaciers made from fallen snow mysterious debris fields found far from the poles on mars were made by glaciers possibly formed just like glaciers are on earth by the buildup of snow researchers say the glaciers would have resembled those found on earth in places such as mount kilimanjaro in africa or the andean peaks in south america the researchers report in the latest issue issue of the journal science they probably formed when mars was tilted on its side million years ago brown university planetary geologist professor james head and colleagues say researchers were intrigued when spacecraft data showed curious rockstrewn deposits at the foot of some martian volcanoes and mountains close to the equator these scrapedup piles of rock and sand in certain valleys and along the western flanks of the three giant volcanoes look like what is left behind by a moving glacier on earth it is now very cold and very dry on the mars surface and water cannot stand in any one place on the planet for long even as ice researchers have speculated whether the tropical glaciers came from snow or perhaps oozed up from underground an ancient climate the team of us and french researchers ran climate simulations that suggest glaciers could have formed when the sun heated up the poles sending snow there into the atmosphere and allowing it to fall elsewhere on the planet the models predict locations for these glaciers that match many of the glacier remnants seen today what we found was that the glaciers were formed from snow brought from the polar regions head says they note that mars often has changed its tilt so that the poles face the sun and the equator gets only oblique sunlight actually it last occurred only fiveandahalf million years ago says dr francois forget of the university of paris who led the team sublime say researchers the suns rays could vapourise the snow in a process known as sublimation also seen here on earth winds would carry the water vapour south up and over the soaring slopes of the tharsis montes volcanoes and the giant olympus mons volcano the vapour would cool and condense into snow which would eventually harden into an icy glacier the findings are important because they tell us that mars has experienced big climate changes in the past the kinds of climate change that led to the great ice age here on earth head says the findings are also interesting because this precipitation pattern may have left pockets of ice scattered across mars this is good information for nasa as officials plan future space missions particularly with astronauts and the am goes to dr karl for promoting greater understanding of the application of science to daily living dr karl kruszelnicki the man responsible for demystifying belly button lint has been awarded an australia day honour for his work as a science communicator dr karls appointment as a member of the order of australia am is the latest in a long list of accolades for the former scientist engineer and paediatric emergency doctor including a ig nobel prize for his belly button lint research kruszelnicki who describes himself as very mediocre as a scientist but pretty good at talking about it says his real achievements have been in making a difference to peoples lives he tells the story of a woman who told him at a book signing that her son once a high school dropout and surf bum decided to become a geneticist after listening to him on triple j radio the boy got himself a phd and is working as a geneticist at harvard university today under circumstances like that i feel that i have done my work kruszelnicki says i used to be a medical doctor and i didnt realise it at the time but the reason i was doing it was to liberate people from what ails them or to help them get to the next stage like a conduit so i think thats what the am is for alternately it might be for my groundbreaking work on belly fluff the secret history of dr karl kruszelnicki was born in sweden across the river from elsinore where hamlet trod the corridors of his castle in shakespeares play at school he was teased for having a weird surname and he grew up to work in a variety of jobs including physicist labourer roadie and tv weatherman today hes a popular media personality and a bestselling author ask about the least known fact about him besides his middle name its sven and he tells you that he testdrives fourwheel drives and is an avid autograph collector who has the signatures of three of the moon walkers he also subscribes to a us worth of scientific literature kruszelnicki says the most important scientific discovery is that you cant mix sewage with drinking water the most overrated is the internet and the biggest unanswered question is why the moon is larger on the horizon the most wayout theory that may one day become reality that one day genetic engineering will allow us to travel through space in the form of a giant magnetic vapour cloud and youll still be able to have sex he says hes also learning to stand up on his malibu surfboard obviously hell be applying the most complex laws of physics to the task its called not falling over he says other australia day

growing a home from living trees instead of building a home from felled timber is the goal of an architect from the massachusetts institute of technology dr mitchell joachim part of the mit media labs smart cities group along with ecological engineer dr lara greden and architect javier arbona propose a home that is actually an ecosystem the fab tree hab goes beyond sustainable housing and socalled green design building with materials that have a low impact on the environment and human health not only does it do zero damage but it will hopefully clean the air says joachim the habitat is based on an ancient gardening method known as pleaching which weaves together tree branches to form living archways lattices or screens in joachims vision the exterior of the living house is shaped over the course of several decades into a protective crisscross of vines interspersed with soil pockets and growing plants a clay and straw composite fills in the gaps to insulate against the cold and heat and keep out moisture he proposes constructing windows manufactured from soybased plastics that would flex with the home as it grows gathering water water would be gathered in a rooftop trough and circulate by gravity through the house where it would be used by the inhabitants filtered through a garden and purified in a pond containing bacteria fish and plants that consume organic waste a composting system would treat human refuse water would also serve to hydrate the plants and the tree itself which would give off water vapour naturally during transpiration and cool the shelter the fab tree hab would also rely on the sun for heat large southfacing windows would absorb warmth in the northern hemispheres winter while windows located on the shady side at ground floor would draw in cool breezes during hot months grow your own furniture the living house would be the holy grail of this art form says richard reames an orgeonbased arborsculptor and author of the book how to grow a chair reames uses grafting and pleaching techniques to grow living chairs benches and tables joachims dream is to plan an entire community based on the living house design but before that can happen he will need to conduct a year or twos worth of sociology and feasibility studies in the meantime he is designing a house in california that will be constructed from recycled and reconstituted materials and living elements the project is called matscape and joachim sees it as an experimental step toward the ultimate living house navigating bubble wrap part of research that may one day help to design space exploration robots crayfish dont just blunder around in the dark bouncing off rocks but use a sophisticated sense of touch to form detailed mental images of their surroundings an australian researcher says professor david macmillan of the university of melbourne has previously piqued the interest of nasa which has applied his earlier work on the crayfish or yabby cherax destructor to developing tiny space exploration robots macmillan says just as humans looking for the bathroom in the middle of the night grope around with their hands yabbies in dark or murky waters use their antennae to orientate themselves they also use chemosensory receptors all over their bodies that allow them to detect chemicals in the water from food mates or predators were trying to find out how crustaceans work out what their world is like he says yabbies are not renowned for having large brains but macmillan says his research published in the current issue of the journal of experimental biology shows the crustaceans have an acute sense of touch that helps them to get around people have made lots of assumptions that theyre not that smart and they dont know whats going on out there but increasingly were finding that they actually put together some pretty sophisticated pictures he says bubble wrap or sandpaper in the study macmillan and colleagues put the crayfish into arenas containing different types of surfaces and structures including bubble wrap and sandpaper basically we asked the animals to tell us whether they could tell the difference he says what were seeing is that they change their behaviour according to the texture of surfaces he says his team is the first to demonstrate that yabbies can discriminate between textures crayfish in space macmillans research feeds into the field of biomimetics where designs found in nature are used in robotics a few years ago he travelled to the us where he met nasa scientists developing miniature independently moving robots to discuss his work on how yabbies move their tails macmillan has just completed more work suggesting yabbies can analyse particular spaces before they enter them and can even recognise places theyve been before and other crayfish we now think weve got evidence that they can do very sophisticated analyses on a space before they even get into it they can detect vibrations and they can remember what theyve experienced before he says pericles probably died of typhoid fever as did as many as onethird of his fellow athenians modern dna analysis of ancient dental pulp suggests that typhoid fever caused the plague that helped to end the golden age in athens scientists say the dna collected from teeth from an ancient greek burial site is similar to a modern organism that causes typhoid fever an infection spread by contaminated food or water studying the historical aspects of infectious disease can be a powerful tool for several disciplines to learn from says dr manolis papagrigorakis of university of athens a coauthor of the study published in the international journal of infectious diseases we believe this report to be of outstanding importance for many scientific fields since it sheds light on one of the most debated enigmas in medical history up to onethird of athenians are thought to have died from the plague that spread to greece from ethiopia egypt and libya in bc several diseases including smallpox bubonic plague anthrax and measles have been suggested as the cause of the plague one of whose most prominent victims was the athenian golden age leader pericles the plague is thought to have changed the balance of power between athens and sparta ending athenian dominance the scientists describe how they extracted dna from a mass burial pit in a cemetery dating back to the time the plague struck greece papagrigorakis and his team say the dna sequences resembled salmonella enterica serovar typhi the organism that causes typhoid fever how much old research is based on fraud details are emerging about the latest case which involves papers in three medical journals a norwegian mouth cancer specialist has admitted to fabricating research data published in several international scientific magazines in the latest fraud case to rock the medical research world a doctor at the institute for cancer research at the norwegian radium hospital dr jon sudboslash has confessed to forging data used to document research published last october in the lancet as well as in two other articles the revelation comes on the heels of the disclosure that south koreas celebrated cloning pioneer professor hwang woosuk had faked research papers claiming breakthroughs in stem cell research suspicion that sudboslash had forged data in the lancet article surfaced earlier this month and several investigations have been launched into his conduct he has indicated that in addition to the article in the lancet two of his other articles contained information in which the conclusions have no basis says sudboslashs lawyer erling lyngtveit the two other articles appeared in the new england journal of medicine in april and the journal of clinical oncology in march it appears that he started cheating a little bit and then the deception got completely out of control in his last article in the lancet the lawyer adds madeup study in the lancet article the doctor maintained that antiinflammatory drugs like aspirin were efficient in preventing mouth cancer but they also increased the risk of cardiovascular disease he based this conclusion on data from fictitious patients of whom had been given the same date of birth this had nothing to do with money lyngtveit insists in different circumstances his motives would be perceived as positive since they are what helps research to move forward the desire to contribute to something the yearning for fame and glory he says adding however that this got completely out of hand in sudboslashs article in the new england journal of medicine he claimed that the resection of the first cancerous cells in the oral cavity did not have an impact on the mortality rate in patients according to his lawyer he now admits he did not have the mortality statistics to back up that claim sudboslashs article in the journal of clinical oncology meanwhile discussed the possibility of calculating which heavy smokers would contract mouth cancer he has now admitted that he had only taken blood tests from some of the patients and not all of them as previously claimed to check if they had continued smoking lyngtveit says over the past decade sudboslash has published articles in international scientific magazines but his lawyer insists that the forgery only occurred in three articles sudboslash acted alone his coauthors contributed to the articles in good faith he adds the case has contributed to further weakening faith in research published in scientific reviews after the widely publicised hwang scandal in hwang claimed to have derived stem cell lines tailored to specific patients which are believed to have the potential to reduce the risk of rejection of new organs in he said he had derived a stem cell from a human embryo but after a monthlong probe a panel of experts from seoul national university found that hwang had created no stem cells of any kind and that his research data was fabricated us research journal science retracted hwangs papers last week the lancet meanwhile stated on its website earlier this week that pending clarification we now issue an expression of concern about the article by sudboslash alkaloids found in magic mushrooms act on the brain to produce changes in perception and hallucinations an australian researcher has developed a new test for mushrooms that produces a glowing light if they contain the hallucinogenic ingredients that make them magic several species of magic mushroom grow in australia mainly in new south wales victoria and south australia nicole anastos who did the research for her phd at deakin university describes her work in the latest issue of the journal of forensic sciences she applied the method to three species of magic mushroom psilocybe subaeruginosa hypholoma aurantiaca and panaeolina foenisecii provided by the royal botanic gardens melbourne the technique uses chemiluminescence a light reaction that occurs when two chemicals react to detect psilocybin and its metabolite psilocin these are the serotoninlike psychoactive ingredients in magic mushrooms magic happens not all molecules exhibit chemiluminescence but mix psilocin with acidic potassium permanganate and psilocybin with ruthenium and magic happens anastos says the technique can detect extremely low levels of psilocin making it the most sensitive test there is and the first time chemiluminescence has been applied to magic mushrooms in the literature theres quite a few pieces published on the analysis of psilocin and psilocybin in magic mushrooms but the analysis time is quite long in some of them she says we wanted a rapid method to detect these alkaloids to date its the most sensitive method published anastos soaked ground up samples of mushroom in methanol and separated the chemical components using high performance liquid chromatography hplc before running the chemoluminescence test a doityourself test kit anastos says she hopes her research will be picked up and developed for use by the police it could possibly also form the basis of a home magicmushroom test kit or a urine test she says associate professor michael dawson head of chemistry materials and forensic sciences at the university of technology sydney says anastos work is interesting chemistry but he says it doesnt offer any real advantage over existing tests mass spectrometry or ultra violet absorption produced equally good results when testing for psilocin and psilocybin in magic mushrooms he says once youve separated the mixture into its individual components theres a whole host of detection methods vikings are continuing to surprise us they didnt have horned helmets as this image suggests and now it seems they filed their teeth possibly as a status symbol viking warriors filed deep grooves in their teeth and they probably had to smile broadly to show them off according to new finds in four major viking age cemeteries in sweden caroline arcini of swedens national heritage board and colleagues analysed skeletons of men women and children from to ad she discovered that of the men bore deep horizontal grooves across the upper front teeth the marks are traces of deliberate dental modifications they are so wellmade that most likely they were filed by a person of great skill arcini writes in the american journal of physical anthropology a journal of the american association of physical anthropologists traces of teeth mutilation have been found in all parts of the world except europe with the practice reaching its peak from to ad during the height of the viking age the vikings were the first europeans to have displayed this custom perhaps because they picked it up during their travels this discovery is important as it shows that signs of cultural contact may happen between people over vast distances arcini says however the reason for and the importance of the furrows remain mysteries the only things that the people have in common are that they were men and that majority had died when they were quite young the filed furrows were made in more or less the same area of the teeth in all individuals arcini says the marks were cut deep into the enamel and occurred often in pairs or triplets to show their furrows the individuals would have had to smile quite broadly arcini says the researcher speculates that the marks could have been some sort of decoration or a badge to indicate class or military rank maybe they were warriors although no skeletal injuries have been detected arcini says a status symbol pia bennike at the university of copenhagens biological anthropology laboratory agrees they did it on purpose to mark that they belonged to a special group or maybe they were slaves this is a very unique and interesting find one hypothesis is that they could show an individuals ability to resist pain they could have also represented some kind of achievement maybe this is the explanation for multiple furrows or deeper ones arcini says the tools that the vikings used for handicrafts were made both of iron and stone an experiment on a medieval tooth showed that with a lot of force and a file of steel it takes about minutes to cut a mark like the those of the vikings in the enamel how long it took on a living person is really difficult to know even if the filing did not hurt it most certainly must have been unpleasant arcini says the new planet may look like this a rockyicy world circling a red dwarf star astronomers have discovered the most earthlike planet so far close to the centre of our galaxy the international team says the planets relatively small size and large orbit imply a rockyicy composition with a thin atmosphere the discovery involving a global network of telescopes and reported in todays issue of the journal nature is good news for astronomers searching for planets outside our solar system that may support life this discovery is a strong hint that these lowermass objects are very common says lead author dr jeanphilippe beaulieu from the institut dastrophysique de paris the discovery of ogleblglb also backs current theoretical models of planetary formation the scientists say these models predict finding planets the size of earth to neptune orbiting red dwarf stars small cool stars between one and times the distance from the earth to our sun the new planet has mass more than five times that of earth and orbits a red dwarf at more than twoandahalf times the distance between the earth and the sun this makes it the first relatively small extrasolar planet discovered not huddled close to its parent star the planet is about light years away near the centre of the milky way and was discovered using a technique astronomers say is better at finding smaller planets hunting for extrasolar planets most extrasolar planets discovered have been hot jupiters or gas giant planets in small orbits detected by the gravitational wobble they induce in the parent star that technique is sensitive to massive planets orbiting nearby stars but the microlensing method can detect much smaller planets orbiting at larger distances around distant stars says new zealands dr michael albrow from the university of canterbury albrow is a founding member of the planet collaboration which found the planet one of the three microlensing collaborations involved from institutions in countries dr andrew williams from australias perth observatory explains how microlensing works the gravity of a dim intervening star acts as a giant natural telescope magnifying a more distant star which brightens temporarily a small defect in the brightening reveals the existence of a planet around the lens star because the chances of exact alignment are very rare astronomers continuously monitor dense star fields such as the galactic centre which is best seen from the southern hemisphere the japanesenew zealand microlensing observations in astrophysics group supplied extra data the group happened to be testing the worlds largest dedicated microlensing telescope at the time a metre telescope at mount john university observatory in tekapo new zealand the adult female is just millimetres long when sexually mature the smallest fish in the world has been found lurking in the peat wetlands of southeast asia say scientists dr maurice kottelat of the national university of singapore and team report their discovery online ahead of print publication in the royal society journal proceedings b the recordbusting newcomer paedocypris progenetica is skinny and transparent and a distant cousin of the carp the researchers say the elusive fish lives in highly acid peat swamps on the indonesian island of sumatra and in the malaysian part of borneo that are threatened by forestry and agriculture the scientists needed a special stereoscopic microscope to accurately measure the fish the smallest adult specimen they netted was a mature female found in sumatra that came to just millimetres from nose to tail this makes her not only the worlds smallest fish but also the worlds smallest vertebrate she nudged out the previous record holder a marine fish of the western pacific called the dwarf goby trimmatom nanus which comes in at millimetres at sexual maturity kottelat says p progenetica has a very rudimentary skull which leaves the brain exposed maybe he should have had sex nervous public speakers should first have penetrative sex to ease the stress according to a uk study but masturbation is unlikely to have the same effect the study published in the latest issue of the journal biological psychology suggests professor stuart brody a psychologist at the university of paisley compared the impact of different sexual activities on blood pressure when a person later undergoes a stressful experience brody asked women and men to keep a diary of their sexual activities for two weeks the volunteers then underwent a stressful ordeal that involved making a speech in public and doing mental arithmetic out loud volunteers who had had penetrative sex during the previous week or so had the least stress and their blood pressure returned to normal fastest after their test penetrative sex was far more effective in this regard than masturbation or oral sex but those who had abstained completely from any sexual activity had the highest stress levels and blood pressure of all brody also did a psychological profile of the volunteers to see whether they had an anxious or neurotic character and evaluated their work stress and satisfaction with their partners even when such factors were taken into account sexual behaviour was clearly the best explanation for the stress responses the effects are not attributable to the shortterm relief afforded by orgasm but rather endure for at least a week brody told new scientist magazine he believes that penetrative sex may release a special pairbonding hormone called oxytocin which accounts for the calming effect adding another electrode to this ion engine improves fuel efficiency tests show promising faster space travel a new ion engine that promises to propel spacecraft faster and further is four times more fuel efficient than the best available scientists say they say the results of recent tests suggest the engine the dual stage four grid thruster dsg would reduce the time for craft to reach mars or pluto and beyond dr orson sutherland and team at the australian national universitys space plasma power and propulsion group designed and built the engine with the european space agency esa sutherland says laboratory tests show the dsg it is four times more fuel efficient than the best ion engines available and times more fuel efficient than used to propel esas smart moon mission the underlying technology has been around for years he says all we did with the dsg is to add some extra components which basically gave it a fold improvement sutherland says missions to pluto and the kuiper belt would be quite easily made with trips out beyond the solar system also more feasible all of that within the working lifetime of a mission scientist he says another option is the new engine could help take heavier missions to shorter distances such as the moon or mars how it works a standard ion engine works by using electrodes to extract ions from plasma in this case heated xenon gas the ions are focused into beams that accelerate through tiny holes in the electrodes and thrust metres out into space propelling the spacecraft in the opposite direction clusters of magnesium zinc and copper atoms could be the key to strengthening lightweight metals an australian phd student has taken the first pictures of clusters of metal atoms which could be the key to tailormade alloys that are light strong durable and flexible peter liddicoat of the university of sydney will present the digital images at a microscopy conference in sydney next month liddicoat analysed the atomic structure of a lightweight alloy used in the aerospace industry the alloy is made of aluminium zinc magnesium and copper heated to c before undergoing a rapid hardening process hardening involves quenching the alloy in water and then reheating it to c after seconds at this temperature the alloy is twice as hard although this hardening process has been used for years liddicoat says no one knows how it works making metal is still a bit of a black art its like cooking he says this work is just trying to get a bit of science back into it some time ago his phd supervisor professor simon ringer proposed a theory that small clusters of atoms in the alloy could be responsible for the hardening and liddicoat is the first to image them first decompose your alloy liddicoat imaged the clusters using strong electromagnetic fields at very low temperatures to decompose the alloy when you decompose this material you actually rip the atoms off one by one he says its actually a very delicate process a d digital image of the alloy and its atoms is then made by computer liddicoat says he is pretty excited to have imaged these clusters and the next step is to confirm that these clusters are responsible for the alloys hardening he hopes to work out how the atoms arrange themselves by taking snapshots of the alloy over time and he wants to characterise the clusters the precise combination of atoms that makes them up the shape of the clusters and how many there are per unit volume of the alloy tailormade alloys liddicoat hopes this will one day make it possible to create materials with specific degrees of flexibility durability and tensile strength if you understand what they are then you might be able to create the conditions to create these things he says an ancient ancestor of todays crocodiles looks like a cross between an ostrich and a dinosaur the discovery of a sixfootlong bipedal and toothless fossil in a museum basement suggests crocodile ancestors looked like some birdlike dinosaurs that lived millions of years later scientists say the crocodile ancestor fossil found in the basement of new yorks american museum of natural history is an example of how similar body types can evolve several times over a museum team excavated the millionyearold fossil in the s from the ghost ranch quarry in new mexico this site has produced numerous fossils of coelophysis small carnivorous dinosaurs that lived in the triassic period as scientists thought coelophysis was the only vertebrate fossil in the quarry the crocodile kin sat forgotten in storage and lodged in a slab of rock for nearly years when graduate student sterling nesbitt opened the plaster jacket encasing the find in he saw an articulated fossil that closely resembled birdlike dinosaurs called ornithomimids or ostrich dinosaurs that lived million years later along with dr mark norell curator of the museums palaeontology division nesbitt reported the finding in the proceedings of the royal society b part bird part dinosaur the creature had large eyes a beak a long tail and no teeth walking on two feet with its tail erect it lived at the end of the triassic with some of the earliest dinosaurs we dont know what the animal ate because it has a beak and extant animals with beaks can eat almost anything says nesbitt while the skull and the skeleton were almost identical to those of ostrich dinosaurs the ankle is typical of an ancient group of reptiles called crocodilians which includes todays crocodiles and alligators the new animal was named effigia okeeffeae after the latin word for ghost referring to the fact that it was invisible to science for so long its name also honours the artist georgia okeeffe who lived near the quarry this is one of the most specialised extinct relative of crocodilians yet known and shows that the duckbilled head that later evolved in ornithomimid dinosaurs first appeared independently in crocodilians relatives says james clark associate professor of biology at the george washington university in washington dc this exciting find tells us once again that crocodilians and their relatives were at one time much more diverse than they are today the fossil has also turned a keystone for identifying other close relatives to effigia says norell the researchers reexamined some isolated triassic reptile specimens and noted that effigia also resembles early theropods twolegged carnivore dinosaurs they concluded that effigialike animals were common in most of the triassic sediments of western north america this would suggest that creatures like the newly discovered fossil dominated what is now the americas and that dinosaur evolution only took off after effigia went extinct clark agrees the fossil record of the triassic and jurassic shows that dinosaur diversity did not take off until after the extinction event at the end of the triassic which included largebodied crocodilian relatives such as aetosaurs phytosaurs and rauisuchians as well as the smaller effigia he says cars run on ethanol would make us less dependent on fossil fuels but does ethanol meet both energy and environmental goals ethanol fuel is more energyefficient than some experts had realised and it is time to start developing it as an alternative to fossil fuels researchers say while some critics say the push for ethanol is based on faulty science and mostly benefits the farm lobby several reviews and commentaries published in todays issue of the journal science argue otherwise we find that ethanol can if it is made correctly contribute significantly to both energy and environmental goals however the current way of producing ethanol with corn probably only meets energy goals says dr alexander farrell at the university of california berkeley farrell and colleagues looked at six studies used to argue for and against the development of ethanol as an energy source one of the main purposes is to explain why the studies found in the literature have such divergent results farrell says some of the studies use what appear to be obsolete data or data whose quality cannot be verified currently ethanol is not a significant source of fuel but is blended with petrol environmentalists hope it could be developed as a cleaner source of fuel than oil or gas the billion litres of ethanol blended into gasoline in amounted to about of all gasoline sold by volume and of its energy content the researchers write pollution and greenhouse gases farrell says it is possible to put ethanol in a car and run it but making ethanol using current technology is expensive and contributes to pollution and greenhouse gases the environmental cost comes entirely from making fertiliser running the tractors over the farm and operating the biorefinery farrell says better methods now being investigated would use the woody parts of plants using what is known as cellulosic technology to break down the tough fibres ethanol can be if its made the right way with cellulosic technology a really good fuel says farrell an assistant professor of energy and resources at the moment cellulosic technology is just too expensive if that changes and the technology is developing rapidly then we might see cellulosic technology enter the commercial market within five years fuel food and chemical from biomass writing in the same journal scientists from imperial college london georgia tech and oak ridge national laboratory in tennessee say they have teamed up to find ways to make a facility to do that their facility would make a range of fuels foods chemicals animal feeds materials heat and power it would use biomass a collection of renewable plant matter and biological material such as trees grasses and agricultural crops were looking at a future for biomass where we use the entire plant and produce a range of different materials from it says dr charlotte williams of imperials chemistry department before we freeze in the dark we must prepare to make the transition from nonrenewable carbon resources to renewable bioresources her team writes an oil industry expert says it is possible credible studies show that with plausible technology developments biofuels could supply some of global demand in an environmentally responsible manner without affecting food production says professor steven koonin chief scientist for bp in london writes in a commentary to realise that goal socalled advanced biofuels must be developed from dedicated energy crops separately and distinctly from food the diet stresses lashings of meat and limits fruit and vegetables the highprotein atkins diet has caused a lifethreatening complication for a woman who strictly followed the diet say us doctors dr tsuhyin chen of lenox hill hospital in new york and team report the case in todays issue of the lancet the atkins diet stresses lashings of meat butter and other dairy products highfat foods typically limited in classic diets but cuts potatoes rice and pasta to negligible levels and greatly limits intake of fruit and vegetables the diets premise is that a carbohydratestarved body will start to burn up stored fat cells a process called ketosis chen and team report seeing a yearold obese woman a month after starting the atkins diet she reported losing kilograms after eating only meat cheese and salads supplemented by minerals and vitamins sold by atkins nutritionals the company founded by diet pioneer robert atkins in the woman was admitted for emergency treatment complaining of a shortness of breath nausea and repeated vomiting that had lasted several days as well as mild gastric pains urine and blood analysis showed she had severe ketoacidosis a condition in which dangerously high levels of ketone acids build up in the liver as a result of a depletion of the hormone insulin ketoacidosis which is more usually seen among diabetics and victims of starvation can lead to a coma the patient responded well to rehydration and glucose infusion and left hospital after four days our patient had an underlying ketosis caused by the atkins diet and developed severe ketoacidosis say the researchers adding that mild pancreatitis or stomach infection may have contributed to the problem this problem may become more recognised because this diet is becoming increasingly popular worldwide diet not nutritionally balanced in a commentary also published in the lancet dr lyn steffen and jennifer nettleton of the university of minnesotas school of public health blast the atkins diet as clearly not nutritionally balanced lowcarbohydrate diets for weight management are far from healthy given their association with ketosis constipation or diarrhoea halitosis headache and general fatigue to name a few they say these diets also increase the protein load to the kidneys and alter the acid balance of the body which result in loss of minerals from bone stores thus compromising bone integrity steffen and nettleton add our most important criterion should be indisputable safety and lowcarbohydrate diets currently fall short of this benchmark the atkins diet builds on a long history of lowcarbohydrate diets that reaches into the th century more than million copies of atkins diet books have been sold and the impact of the fad has been farreaching elevating meat and lowcarb dishes over pasta potatoes and rice atkins nutritionals emerged from bankruptcy protection earlier this year specialising as a company that sells lowcarb bars and shakes a us firm that handles the companys relations with the media says it cannot comment on the paper published in the lancet the findings suggest that drinking water might help decrease your sensitivity to pain going without a drink can make you more sensitive to pain a study has found australian pain expert dr michael farrell of the howard florey institute in melbourne and team report their findings in todays issue of the proceedings of the national academy of sciences this is another demonstration of the plasticity of pain responses he says in this particular instance a mild perturbation of electrolyte levels which is fundamentally what gives rise to thirst is enough to modify the pain response farrell and team studied the relationship between thirst and pain in people the study participants had pressure applied to their thumbs to induce mild pain and were given saline injections to stimulate thirst the researchers used a pet or positron emission tomography scan to measure blood flow in the brains before and after the results showed that people who were thirsty felt more pain two regions of the brain the pregenual cingulate and ventral orbitofrontal cortex which were not turned on by either input alone lit up suggesting a location where the two sensations were being integrated the researchers did not find that pain affected thirst levels but farrell says this could be because the participants were not made very thirsty in the first place and any decrease would have been hard to measure the logic behind the findings farrell says the team had speculated there might be circuits in the brain that allow one sensation to modulate another which is important from the point of view of survival hunger thirst tiredness and pain for example dont conveniently happen at the same time he says so its important for the body to prioritise he says pain is accentuated because it is more important to survival than mild thirst the sensation with the most immediate implications for survival is pushed to the forefront of attention says farrell drinking to cut pain farrell says the findings suggest it could be wise for people who are about to go through a painful experience should drink more water beforehand he says evidence from different types of studies also support this relationship between drinking water and pain but could people deliberately use dehydration to maximise pain say via torture not necessarily says farrell we suspect if they got dehydrated enough that the overwhelming sense of thirst would probably make pain less rather than more previous studies in rats have shown that mild thirst makes the animals feel more pain but severe dehydration actually dulls pain he says and he says this too makes sense from the point of view of survival if you were very dehydrated it would pay to suppress pain because it might get in the way of your search for water he says ethical limitations of the study farrell says it would have been too hard on the study participants who already spent up to three hours on the table to test whether drinking decreased pain theyve got this plastic mask holding their head perfectly still and theyve got both arms spread out one of them with a hypertonic solution going into one vein and the other one getting radioactive isotopes it would have been intolerable he says and testing whether dehydration would have dulled pain would be similarly tricky ethically he says relatives of this snail left an unusual evolutionary trail they may have hitched a ride around the world on the back of migratory birds to form new species on distant islands the animal kingdoms leastlikely islandhopping creatures land snails have managed to jump from europe to the azores scientists say they then jumped some kilometres of snaildissolving ocean to the isolated tristan da cunha island group deep in the south atlantic the remarkable and mysterious dispersal abilities of the land snails belonging to the balea genus have resulted in the evolution of eight new tristan island species it was the snails genes that gave away their ancestors immigration patterns according to a study in the latest issue of the journal nature researchers still dont know how the snails made the trip one possibility is that a tiny juvenile member of the hermaphroditic snail became stuck in the feathers of a wading bird that was blown off course and ended up on the islands says dr richard preece of the university of cambridge a coauthor on the nature paper the problem is that these are land snails and they dont like salt as you well know says the university of hawaiis dr robert cowie a snail researcher who is working on a very similar but far larger study on the dispersal history of pacific land snails salt water pretty much rules out one common way for animals and plants to reach islands by raft in fact it was charles darwin who tested whether selfsealed land snails could survive on logs or other floating debris in the end he preferred the idea that birds brought them but there is a third possibility says cowie the snails might have flown without birds there have been wind tunnel studies of how far juvenile snails from greek islands can blow in the wind it has been calculated that small snails can be blown more than kilometres in the pacific we have even tinier snails says cowie whats more most of them live in trees where they could conceivably be caught on a freed leaf during a hurricane and carried for thousands of miles so theres that scenario which makes it even more possible to imagine flying snails to get the present numbers and diversity of snails on the hawaiian islands for instance cowie and his colleagues figure that theyd only need one snailcarrying hurricanedriven leaf to reach the islands every years as for the tristan da cunha island snails it could be birds or storms that brought them there says cowie at present there is no easy way to find out the genetic code of marsupials has been documented for the first time with the sequencing of the opossum genome the sequencing of the first marsupial genome has allowed researchers to trace the immune system of mammals back to what theyve dubbed an ancestral immune supercomplex and the research suggests that the human immune system in its present form is a surprisingly recent innovation says australian evolutionary biologist dr kathy belov from the university of sydney who led the international team the grey shorttailed opossum monodelphis domestica found in south america is the first marsupial to have its genome sequenced the sequencing was done at the broad institute in the us and the current research represents the first gene cluster characterised belov and colleagues from australia europe and the us report their research on the region known as the major histocompatibility complex mhc in the journal plos biology today the research has helped form a picture of what that region would have looked like in ancestral mammals belov says that picture shows a central complex of immune genes that have since dispersed and are now scattered around a variety of chromosomes a supercomplex of immunity were finding that the opossum has a couple of genes in their mhc which arent in the mhc of other species and other species have genes in their mhc which arent in other species belov says by tracing it back we can see that originally there was this big cluster of immune genes and over time those genes have moved out of this central complex it suggests there was one big immune gene supercomplex in a mammalian ancestor its a bit like a dinosaur in that we only know that its around from the fossil evidence belov will also examine the mhc in the platypus the first monotreme or egglaying mammal to have its genome sequenced understanding immune systems will help to conserve vulnerable species belov says mammal evolution its believed that the first monotreme appeared about million years ago and marsupial and placental mammalian lineages separated around million years ago south american and australian marsupials split about million years ago with the break up of the southern supercontinent gondwana and continued to evolve separately today the south american and australian groups are about as different as humans and mice belov says belov says birds and other nonmammals have a relatively simple mhc whereas in placental mammals it is much more complex marsupial mhc turns out be intermediate she says this suggests that theres been some major changes in the human immune system that have gone on quite recently and theyre probably more recent than a lot of people expected comparing marsupials a project to sequence the genome of australias tammar wallaby being done jointly by the australian genome research facility and the human genome sequencing center in the us will complement work on the opossum says belov belov also has an australian research council grant to study the mhc in the tammar wallaby if we have the tammar wallaby sequence and the opossum sequence we can pretty much predict the sequences of all the other marsupials she says this person of european descent is most likely to have wet gooey earwax now scientists know why geneticists say they know why people from some parts of the world have wet gooey earwax and others have the dry flaky stuff they describe online today in the journal nature genetics how a single gene controls its consistency human earwax is a secretion that traps insects cleans the ear and prevents the outer parts of the auditory canal from drying out but cerumen to give it its scientific name has long puzzled researchers who have debated why different populations have a different consistency for example dry earwax is more common in people from china and other countries in eastern asia and people of european or african descent are more likely to have the wet variety dr kohichiro yoshiura from nagasaki university and colleagues say mutations in a single gene hold the key by looking at japanese people with different types of earwax they identified the gene abcc which codes for a type of cell channel this channel acts as a kind of gate to control the flow of molecules which in turn determines wax type a mutation in this gene alters the channels structure and reduces its activity affecting the wax consistency people who inherit two copies of the mutant gene one from each parent have dry earwax any other combination gives you goo the authors compared the gene with earwax genes from different populations around the world plotting a timemap of where and when the gene mutated they conclude that the change in the channel type first occurred in northeast asia a change that then spread throughout asia and to native american and inuit populations with asian origins facial tumour disease can leave the face of australias carnivorous marsupial looking like pizza researcher annemaree pearse says the mysterious facial tumour disease ripping through australias tasmanian devil population may be an infectious cancer spread by biting a researcher says annemaree pearse of tasmanias department of primary industries water and environment reports in the journal nature today that the tumour cells are chromosomally identical despite being found in different animals suggesting the existence of a rogue cell line the thrust of my theory is that a cell line developed in a cancer in a devil somewhere some time she says this cell line became persistent and basically had an existence of its own and is just passing through the population like an epidemic pearse says during fights mutated tumour cells may break away from the ulcerated tumour of a diseased devil and become transplanted into a healthy devil where they form the seed of a new tumour we propose that the disease is transmitted by allograft whereby an infectious cell line is passed directly between the animals through bites they inflict on one another she writes facial tumour disease which first became apparent in the mid s is now present across more than half of the southern island state and has cut the tasmanian devil sarcophilus harrisii population in some parts by up to according to the tasmanian government genetic bottlenecks pearse says devils may be particularly susceptible to the disease because of genetic bottlenecks caused by past population crashes the crashes resulted in a loss of genetic diversity which may have caused a net weakening of the devils immune defences she says her colleague dr menna jones a conservation biologist from the university of tasmania says the cell line transmission theory is backed by her own research done with rodrigo hamede into devil fighting and biting behaviour given what we know about the ecology and behaviour of devils if youre going to pick any species that might transmit any pathogen or disease by biting devils would be a very likely candidate jones says the theory comes as good news for those involved in combating the disease she says whats nice about the allograph theory is that it does make disease suppression or disease control simpler she says if transmission is simply transfer of tumour cells from devil to devil the most effective thing you can do is simply to take sick animals out of the population jones says the research comes as the tasmanian government prepares to launch a twoyear disease suppression study in the states southeast following a successful pilot last year the study will monitor the impact of isolating an estimated devils that live on tasmanias forestier and tasman peninsulas where the disease hasnt yet established a stronghold they will be separated from the mainland with devilproof grates can it spread to humans pearse who also has a background in human cytogenetics says studying devil facial tumour will advance understanding of cancer in humans she says theres no human equivalent of a transmissible cancer but there have been cases where organ transplant patients have developed cancer if cells were hidden in the donor organ she says its highly unlikely devil facial tumour disease could spread to other species including humans but this will be the subject of future research this old spacesuit will be tossed out of the international space station at the weekend to become a cheap homespun satellite itll transmit messages back to earth until its batteries die out then become space junk three russian spacesuits are being prepared for a spacewalk at the weekend from the international space station but only two will be coming back inside when the planned sixhour excursion is over theres no mutiny in the works though it would be easy to think so after watching what station commander bill mcarthur and flight engineer valery tokarev have in mind theyll be tossing the third suit overboard no one will be inside the freeflying suit rather it is stuffed with old clothes batteries and a couple of electronics boxes an antenna is fixed to the suits helmet then it becomes a freeflying satellite in orbit around earth until its batteries die and it becomes orbiting space junk because its orbit is relatively low it will be pulled back into earths atmosphere within a few weeks or months and be incinerated the being does have a name suitsat and a message though you will need an antenna and radio receiver to hear it run by amateurs suitsat is an innovative budgetfree volunteer effort of an international amateur radio organisation its equipped with a series of messages that last seconds and a picture that will be continuously transmitted for as long as its batteries hold out the idea was brought up at an amateur radio symposium in october says amateur radio operator lou mcfaden of orlando at the time we had started figuring out a project that we could do that was low enough in power a russian representative brought up that russian space officials had been trying to find something more useful for these old suits they had on the station just in time the project quickly gained momentum but time was short with donated equipment and volunteer time suitsat was pulled together in a matter of weeks delivered to nasa transported to russia and launched aboard a cargo ship that arrived in september its mission is set to begin at the weekend thousands of amateur radio buffs are expected to try to pick up suitsats transmission during its relatively short lifetime the suits batteries likely will last only a few days says mcfaden who built the hardware suitsat also contains a cd with hundreds of pictures artwork poems and signatures of students worldwide project organisers already have their eyes on another russian spacesuit expected to be decommissioned later this year or in were hoping to be able to do it again says mcfadin we already decided some things we want to do on the next one if we get the chance tuning in suitsats signal will be transmitted on mhz fm all you need is an antenna the bigger the better and a radio receiver that you can tune to mhz fm says frank bauer with nasas goddard space flight center a police band scanner or a handtalkie ham radio would work just fine a log of people who have made contact will be available on the suitsat website suitsat is an outgrowth of the amateur radio project already operating aboard the space station amateur radio

infected hundreds of thousands of computers and could erase many everyday files on february security experts warn the kama sutra worm which targets microsoft adobe and zip files is a threat because many users will not know the virus has infected their computers until it is too late security experts say they also estimate that the worm which spreads by emailing itself to addresses in an infected computers mailbox may already have slipped onto to machines and is now simply waiting to obliterate files on friday the virus also known as grewa or mywife tricks users by appearing as an email attachment with subject lines such as hot movie give me a kiss and miss lebanon some variations refer to the ancient kama sutra guide to elaborate sexual positions to attract attention and convince victims to open the email it claims to be a movie or picture with some sort of sexual content says johannes ullrich chief research officer at the nonprofit sans institute research group that is how it tricks you the virus causes a keyboard and mouse to freeze it then disables antivirus programs when the computer is restarted leaving a machine vulnerable says ken dunham rapid response director at verisign corps security unit idefense the virus mainly has infected computers of vulnerable consumers and small businesses which are far less likely to have uptodate security software he says the kama sutra worm also stands out because its primary purpose is to destroy files rather than to seek financial gain or to take control of a computer security experts say dunham says any users who suspect they may have triggered the worm should reinstall an antivirus program and make sure the virus has been removed it is already under way and will be activated unless people get removal tools he says if you have opened an email and your computer froze up you should be very concerned humans may have domesticated dogs much more recently than dna studies suggest one of the most extensive surveys of the earliest known dog burials suggests humans domesticated canines much later than other studies show the survey which suggests domestication occurred between and years ago counters some earlier theories based on gene changes that distinguish dogs from their wild wolf counterparts a few of those theories held that domestication occurred anywhere between and years ago much earlier than the new study suggests the new study published in the february issue of the journal of archaeological science suggests that the bond between humans and dogs coincides with canine burials the earliest known morphological evidence of what was probabably dog remains dates to around years ago in central russia but the practice of burying dogs appears to have begun between and years ago burying dogs then became more common around years ago this was a time of major population expansion starting with for our purposes colonisation for the first time of eastern eurasia and finally on into the new world says author darcy morey an assistant professor in archaeology from the university of kansas this is just me being mushy and fuzzy but it seems that folks were a little more willing to try things like drift into previously unoccupied expanses and maybe engage in humananimal associations that resulted in domestication morey believes the canine genetic break from wolves may not be linked to domestication quite simply if the dog and wolf genomes really did separate as long ago as some molecular studies have suggested or even in that vicinity the animals that were destined to become dogs must have made their living for some time essentially in the oldfashioned way like wolves he says an evolving relationship the burials reveal our evolving relationship with dogs often dog skeletons lay alongside human ones in one yearold swedish grave archaeologists found the remains of a dog stretched out on the legs of a deceased man as though the man hoped to hold and pet his canine friend for eternity the dogs neck was broken indicating that it had been killed when its owner died dogs buried without humans in north and central america still show a loving touch and possibly a ritualised internment a grave found in what is now rhode island for example contains a prehistoric dog that was arranged to lie on its left side with its front paw under its head sign of the times the age and condition of the dogs when they died also reveal domestication and the bond with humans according to morey he describes a middle archaic burial dating from to years ago that was found in what is now tennessee the male dog discovered in the grave was unusually old its skeleton indicates the animal suffered from traumatic injuries arthritis a persistent infection and broken bones some of which had healed and some that had not the pathological condition of this individual suggests that the owner insured the safety and wellbeing of the individual throughout its life since it is doubtful that given all the traumatic and age degenerative manifestations the dog could have survived in the absence of care morey explains more evidence christyann darwent an assistant professor of anthropology at the university of california at davis says she agrees with moreys time window for dog domestication dogs and humans could have been hanging out together long before years ago but domestication means we were manipulating their breeding and that probably didnt happen until more recently she says the burials represent some of the best evidence we have for the strong social ties that exist between dogs and humans darwent says domestication has benefited dogs and humans but she suggests humans should take responsibility for their alteration of canines over the millennia some dogs such as my own pet are so reliant on humans that they could never fend for themselves in the wild she says we must remember that we have manipulated them so much with domestication that they often must depend upon us now for their survival moroccan runner hicham el guerroujs world record will be left in the dust one day according to a mathematical analysis of times for the mens one mile race athletes could run the mile seconds faster than the current record according to an australian mathematician whos gone back over the past hundred years of records dr michael deakin of melbournes monash university first calculated the absolute limit for the distance years ago when he declared it to be minutes seconds he will tell a meeting of the australian and new zealand industrial and applied mathematics group later today that he has since revised the data he now says athletes could run the mile in minutes seconds much faster than the existing record of minutes seconds set by moroccos hicham el guerrouj in deakin says more sophisticated computing technology and more records led him to revisit his earlier work the reason for revisiting my original study is twofold he says theres a much bigger data set than there used to be and secondly youve got all sorts of computational tools you didnt back then so i thought id give it another run for its money he didnt make any estimate of when if ever this new height in athletic performance would be scaled deakin arrived at the figure using nonlinear trend analysis a branch of statistics commonly used in economic forecasting i plot the different records and then i drive a trend curve through it which cuts out all the ups and downs he says the idea of the trend curve is to have a line at the top which more or less always will be achieved and a line at the bottom which is never to be achieved in the past hes also used the method to estimate calcium in the bodies of dialysis patients and the trajectory of arrows as described in a passage of ancient roman poetry a three minute mile the mile the equivalent of metres has been replaced by the metres but is still common in some countries and although international athletics bodies now only recognise world records for metric distances they have made an exception for the mile and still keep records today the mile was once famed for the minute barrier which was thought to be impossible until englishman roger bannisters time of a little over minutes seconds in speculation has now shifted to the minute barrier although most experts agree that athletes are unlikely to meet this without some sort of assistance dr shane brun a senior lecturer in medicine at james cook university and vicepresident of sports doctors australia says its almost impossible to predict the bounds of athletic performance but humans will reach a stage where they simply cant get any better without some form of modification he says whether thats through evolution or science or drugs we just dont know he says new measurements of planet ub dubbed xena show its diameter is about kilometres larger than plutos so will ub be named the solar systems th planet xena the possible th planet in our solar system is even larger then pluto research shows astronomers led by professor frank bertoldi of germanys university of bonn publish their findings today in the journal nature they say they have measured reflected solar radiation from xena or ub to give it its official name using a metre telescope in spain the result ub has a diameter of about kilometers about kilometres larger than plutos this would make ub the largest solar system object to be spotted since the discovery of neptune in astronomers have been debating the status of ub ever since the announcement last year that it had been discovered billion kilometres from earth plutos defenders blasted it saying it was not a planet but a vulgar rock astronomers get abusive the polite term for such abuse is a kbo kuiper belt object for the estimated pieces of icy primeval debris that slowly encircle the sun on the outskirts of the solar system far beyond the orbit of neptune the ub supporters club responded tartly claiming that if anything deserved the moniker of kbo it was pluto for one thing pluto discovered in by american clyde tombaugh has a weird unplanetary orbital plane it is a whole deg off the horizontal plane taken by the eight other planets its path around the sun is also so eggshaped that for years of its year orbit its inside the track of neptune itself now weighing powerfully in this groups favour are the first detailed measurements of ubs size if the data is accepted by a special member panel set up by the international astronomical union to determine what constitutes a planet pluto faces being booted out of the solar systems elite club and downgraded to a mere kbo either that or the planetary list will have to expand to include ub and possibly many others times running out for bertoldi time is running out for pluto as the solar systems outermost planet since ub is decidedly larger than pluto it is now increasingly hard to justify calling pluto a planet if ub is not also given this status he says plutos humiliation is knowledges gain though the discovery of a solar system object larger than pluto is very exciting says dr wilhelm altenhoff of the max planck institute for radio astronomy a veteran watcher of asteroids and comets it tells us that pluto which should properly also be counted to the kuiper belt is not such an unusual object maybe we can find even other small planets out there which could teach us more about how the solar system formed and evolved the kuiper belt objects are the debris from its formation an archaeological site containing pristine remnants of the solar nebula from which the sun and the planets formed ub has yet to be given an official name professor michael brown the california institute of technology astronomer who led the team that discovered ub informally calls it xena after the warrior princess of tv fame but if the object is confirmed as a planet he will be under pressure to name it like the nine others after a figure from greek or roman mythology in a naming competition run by the magazine new scientist readers suggestions included persephone pax galileo and cerberus as well as rupert and bob last october brown and his team announced that xena had a moon called gabrielle named after the onscreen warriors travelling companion pigeons will soon be equipped with a mobile phone to text their air pollution reports back to us on the ground a flock of pigeons will monitor the sky for pollution then beam back their findings to a special pigeon blog scientists say the pigeons will carry a gps satellite tracking receiver air pollution sensors and a basic mobile phone according to a report in new scientist magazine the phone will allow text messages on air quality to be beamed back in real time to a website miniature cameras slung around the pigeons necks will also post aerial pictures the idea is the brainchild of researcher beatriz da costa an assistant professor at the university of california at irvine and two of her students they have built a prototype of the pigeons equipment containing a mobile phone circuit board with sim card and communication chips a gps receiver and sensors capable of detecting carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide we are combining an air pollution sensor with a homemade mobilephone da costa told new scientist the team is planning to squeeze all the components onto a single board small enough for the birds to carry in a backpack the report says the pigeons will take to the air at the intersociety for electronic arts annual symposium in san jose in august the data they send back will be displayed on the blog in the form of an interactive map adding an immune system booster to diluted vaccines may mean a little vaccine goes a long way much smaller doses of vaccines may be needed to combat outbreaks of bird flu tuberculosis and sars than once thought canadian research shows the research by a team at the university of british columbia could mean more shots will be available the team led by professor wilfred jefferies says standard doses can be reduced fold and still be safe by adding an immune system booster commonly found in the human body the study shows that when the immune system booster is added at low doses to vaccines and injected into mice exposed to rabies measles and smallpox an immune response kicks in to protect them from infection the socalled tap molecules deliver peptides inside cells from the bodys immune system or vaccines if this transporter is switched off as in cancerous cells disease fighters cannot be moved where they need to go within the cell to do their job the results of the sevenyear study were published in a recent issue of the journal plos pathogens this new paradigm is shown to be applicable to many viruses including poxviruses and could significantly advance the creation of new vaccines and improve those that already exist the scientists say this could prove especially important if the hn bird flu expected by many to be the next worldwide pandemic begins to pass between humans what happens in a bird flu outbreak bird flu has killed some people since emerging in asia in experts say it could kill millions if it mutates into a form easily passed between humans it could take up to six months to develop a vaccine should humantohuman transmission occur with smaller dose sizes a hundred times more vaccine shots could be made within the same period of time were hoping it will be incorporated into a number of different vaccines says jefferies its powerful because we think it can make general vaccines much better smaller doses will also make some vaccines including that for smallpox and anthrax less toxic and therefore better tolerated by those with weaker immune systems jefferies says hiv patients in particular could benefit as well as up to an estimated of the population who react badly to vaccines some pathogens dont currently have effective vaccines says coauthor timothy vitalis i hope the technology can be used to solve some of the needs in controlling infectious diseases how do you boost a vaccine jefferies first imagined the possibility of this application for vaccines after noticing that tap is turned off in cancer cells meaning that the bodys natural immune defense does not recognise that it needs to attack these cells he found that when tap was added to the cancerous cells the immune system suddenly switched on and fought back tap is a key molecule in the creation of immune responses says jefferies this molecule fought viruses when it was found in normal amounts in the cell i thought if a little bit is good is a lot of tap even better researchers say they are not sure why the tap molecules are turned off in cancer cells but hope further study may eventually lead to a new cancer treatment too but that is still years away jefferies says the team is currently trying the method out with prototype vaccines that could lead to clinical trials in the next two years depending on funding the research was primarily funded by the canadian institutes of health research this image shows the flash of light emitted when the deep impact probe smashed into the comet the comet nucleus is in blue and maroon and the impact flash is ringed in multiple colours ice has been detected on the nucleus or solid body of a comet for the first time researchers report they say that comet tempel the target of nasas deep impact space probe has three patches of ice on its surface but most of the frozen water probably lurks deeper inside coinvestigator dr jessica sunshine and colleagues report their findings online today in the journal science the surface ice was detected by instruments on board the probe before it crashed into the comet in july last year cameras spotted several patches bluer than surrounding areas and infrared spectroscopy confirmed these patches were water ice the scientists suspect the ice is in large grains probably aggregates and the deposits are impure with only a small fraction being water ice the rest consisting of dust the surface deposits are also not enough to account for the water vapor in the cloud of gas and dust that surrounds the comets nucleus the scientists say these new findings are significant because they show that our technique is effective in finding ice when it is on the surface says professor michael ahearn of the university of maryland the projects principal investigator we can also therefore firmly conclude that most of the water vapor that escapes from comets is contained in ice particles found below the surface into the heart of a comet deep impact slammed into the comet last year aiming to collect data about the comets heart comets are of particular interest because they are believed to be made up of the leftover debris from the gas dust rocks and ice that formed the outer planets in our solar system some billion years ago scientists have long known that comets contain substantial amounts of ice but before deep impact they did not know how ice was distributed throughout the comets nucleus some astronomers believe comets seeded earth with some of the water and carbonbased molecules that make up living things neanderthals used their knowledge of animal behaviour to hunt mountain goats like these caucasian turs just like early humans did neanderthals did not disappear because modern humans were better hunters and thus outcompeted them for resources say us and israeli anthropologists on the contrary they were top predators who knew how to hunt the biggest and fastest of the animals neanderthals went extinct about years ago after having inhabited europe and parts of asia for roughly years the reason for their demise has been long debated and frequently attributed to modern humans greater intelligence and consequently greater hunting skills but evidence from animal remains hunted by neanderthals clearly indicates these hominids were as good as any early modern humans at hunting report daniel adler an assistant professor and palaeoanthropologist at the university of connecticut and colleagues in the february issue of the journal current anthropology the researchers examined abundant faunal remains in particular thousands of bones belonging to a mountain goat species called the caucasian tur that still exists today the trove was excavated at ortvale klde a rock shelter in the southern caucasus in the republic of georgia dated to between and years ago evidence of killing there was no doubt that the animals were hunted and killed indeed the bones featured cut marks from human butchering and fragmentations typical of marrow consumption showing that meat processing behaviours were not significantly different between neanderthals and modern humans given the abundance of animals one might think that neanderthals would kill as many animals as possible regardless of age and therefore nutritional returns says adler but analysis of tooth wear revealed that twothirds of the animals were animals of prime age the strongest fastest most nutritious and most difficult to capture members of the herd neanderthals like the modern humans that followed them were quite savvy choosing instead to maximise their dietary intake per energy expended by hunting prime age adults given the species involved and the rough terrain this would require sophisticated hunting tactics and knowledge of animal behaviour in particular migration routes and flight behaviour and group cooperation adler says expert timing neanderthals timed their hunts for late autumn to early spring during the caucasian turs seasonal migration to lower elevations where the site of ortvale klde is located they maintained an intimate relationship with their environment and were capable of understanding exactly where and when particular resources could be found in abundance adler says archaeologist john shea an associate professor at stony brook university says the study is excellent precisely what is needed a comparison of how neanderthals and modern humans used the same landscape close enough in time so that any differences discovered reflect behavioural differences and not environmental ones still a mystery shea believes that multiple factors varying from region to region may have played a role in the disappearance of neanderthals the simple answer to the question of why neanderthals became extinct is nobody knows but studies like this one certainly move us a lot closer to being able to make more clearly testable hypotheses he says now the hypothesis that neanderthals became extinct because they were ineffective hunters is in deep trouble a book at bedtime doesnt guarantee children become better readers in the long run researchers say their genes play a bigger role genes rather than reading to young children at home have a greater influence on how they learn to read once they reach school researchers say the study published in the latest issue of the journal of research in reading is the first to demonstrate the influence of genes on potential reading ability in children younger than six the study of preschool age twins from australia the us norway and sweden followed into their early school years found genetic variability accounted for most of the differences in skills that predicted later reading ability these skills included understanding the sounds in words familiarity with letters and verbal fluency australian researcher brian byrne professor of psychology from the university of new england in armidale stresses that the amount of time carers spend reading to children at home is important but the research shows the significance of supporting preschool age children who are having difficulties with letters and words if a child is reading poorly in part because they are not as genetically wellendowed as other children we know we will need to work harder and devote more resources to get them up to scratch says byrne by the end of their second year at school the australian children in the study show almost no trace of the influence of their home environment on reading ability he says and the influence of genetic variability actually increases as children get older he adds we dont know which genes are involved but some of the genes in question affect brain development maybe even embryonically my guess is that in about five years we will have identified a suite of actual genes that are driving this identifying children with problems byrne says the study highlights the importance of identifying children much earlier who might develop reading disorders especially dyslexia there is evidence that early and focused intervention for potential reading disorders in children with family histories of dyslexia can lead to gradelevel performance in the early school years he says our findings should act as a spur to continued research to adoption of the best evidencebased teaching practices and to early identification of children at risk for reading disability dna evidence has questioned the quality of tzis sperm which may have affected his standing in stone age society a stone age man found frozen in the alps some years after he was murdered under mysterious circumstances may have been a childless social outcast a new study shows italian anthropologist dr franco rollo from the university of camerino studied fragments of the dna belonging to tzi as the mummy has become known rollo and his colleagues describe in the american journal of physical anthropology how he found two typical mutations common among men with reduced sperm mobility a high percentage of men with such a condition are sterile according to the museum that stores tzi the iceman insofar as the iceman was found to possess both mutations the possibility that he was unable to father offspring cannot be eliminated says the south tyrol museum of archaeology in the alpine town of bolzano this not improbable hypothesis raises new questions concerning his social rank within his society it adds arguing that the new evidence supports a theory that views the man as a social outcast hikers discovered tzi in the mountains between italy and austria in in scientists found an arrowhead in the icemans shoulder blade and tests revealed blood from four different people on his clothes and a cut in his hand possibly from a fight medicine in the mans pockets and sophisticated weapons seemed to indicate that he was a shaman or a chieftain one theory says tzi was the victim of a power struggle in his own tribe a rival theory proposes the opposite that he was a reject rollo and his colleagues were also able to assign the mummys dna to one of the basic groups of human dna historically occurring in europe his basic dna resembles that of the ladines an ethnic group still living in the region today and that of residents of the tztal valley where he was found the museum says the discovery of plant viruses in human faeces raises questions about the safety of human waste as fertiliser faeces from healthy humans contains live viruses most of which are plant viruses that could sicken and deform plants an international study shows the finding published in the current issue of the journal plos biology could have implications for the use of human waste as fertiliser collected water otherwise known as reclaimed or grey water may also contain deadly plant viruses but future studies are needed to determine if such water which is sometimes used for irrigation can infect plants the researchers say the viruses we pass probably do not harm us and airborne transmission is unlikely instead the viruses probably hitch a ride through the human body via food even when the food is cooked or dried the fact that we could detect plant viruses in mixtures of foods consumed by the study donors suggests that the plant viruses found in human faeces originate from our food says mya breitbart one of the studys authors a san diego state university biologist for example pmmv pepper mild mottle virus was detected in processed chilli sauces and chilli powder but not in fresh peppers pmmv survives processing of foods and passage through the human gut and the viral particles are known to be extremely stable she adds there is no evidence that people should try to avoid getting this virus it most likely has no adverse effects on human health plants are not so lucky peppers infected with this virus can experience stunted growth and sunken brown spots that look like rot on the fruit the researchers found the pepper virus in of human faeces samples collected from healthy individuals in california and singapore the virus might even multiply in the human gut the researchers say as the amount in the faeces was more than the virus load measured in food the scientists analysed in detail the faeces from two of the test subjects who came from san diego and were able to identify rna virus sequences representing known plant viruses two animal viruses one yeast virus and four bacteria one of the animal viruses is linked to diarrhoea while the other moloney murine leukaemia virus has been linked to cancer in humans and animals some of the identified plant viruses are known to harm consumable crops including fruits vegetables tobaccos and cereals i am not aware of any cases where a plant virus has mutated into a virus that caused harm to humans however it is important to understand and characterise the viruses that are present in the guts of healthy humans in order to understand what is happening in the case of disease breitbart says for example if we want to look at the viruses associated with gastrointestinal problems we will need a baseline to compare against she even thinks humans might someday benefit from plant viruses since scientists might be able to deliver medications for diarrhoea and other intestinal disorders using the viruses now that it is known the viruses survive the acidic arduous journey through our bodies surprised david relman associate professor of microbiology immunology and medicine at stanford university says is surprised to see a plant virus dominate in terms of relative abundance to such an extent one might then wonder whether this is simply a relatively unique finding to one or few individuals with a specific dietary proclivity but these investigators show that the findings are relevant to a diverse group of humans he does not think the findings are worrisome it is probably the case that these viruses have been with us for some time relman says a waiting room questionnaire will make it easier for doctors to spot people anxious about their health but with no physical symptoms psychologists say one in australian patients suffers from imaginary ills the countrys first study into the prevalence of hypochondria reveals the research by psychologist dr john franklin of macquarie university and colleagues which will be submitted for publication looked at patients who attended family doctor surgeries across the state of new south wales it found of the population presented with a primary diagnosis of hypochondriasis thats quite high franklin says it is generally estimated that only a third of patients who visit a general practitioner have a condition that is purely physical at least a half but variously estimated at about twothirds have a condition thats in some part the result of social or psychological factors franklin says roughly a third of the total patients actually have what you might call a psychosomatic condition which is something that has a physical manifestation but has really got an underlying psychological cause health anxiety franklin and his team went further to specifically investigate hypochondriasis a condition where a person believes they have a serious illness in the absence of confirming physical evidence this is more than just a psychosomatic condition its a condition where the patient actually believes that they have something seriously wrong with themselves franklin says patients with hypochondriasis or health anxiety as psychologists prefer to describe it usually complain of physical symptoms but these tend to be vague and nonspecific the patients in the study were assessed using a questionnaire devised by franklin and his colleagues called the health anxiety interview schedule franklin says the form was designed as an alternative to the current international standard the whiteley index which he says isnt specific enough and doesnt link into the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders criteria for hypochondriasis a new test the new test is described in the current journal of psychosomatic research franklin says it is more targeted more streamlined and designed to be filled out by patients in the general practitioners waiting room the score they get can alert the gp to the possibility that there are social or psychological issues that might be going on he says questions relate to symptoms physical signs what the patient thinks is wrong how long theyve had concerns whether they have found previous explanations reassuring and whether other doctors are seeing them on average patients who fell into the health anxiety category were seeing between three and four doctors the research found franklin says its important to identify patients with health anxiety because along with children in the first year of life and people in their last this group uses the lions share of health resources mmm definitely rage computers are learning to recognise your emotions and soothe your stress wouldnt it be great if your computer could recognise when youre frustrated with it and adjust itself to calm you down emotionsensing technology could someday allow a computer to do just that researchers say computer scientist christian peter of germanys fraunhofer institute for computer graphics and his colleagues are working on a system that collects data about a persons emotional state using sight sound and touch technology the system then interprets the information and reacts accordingly for example if a computer senses that its user is agitated it might tone down the background colour of the screen turn down background music enlarge or reduce graphics adjust the flow of information being presented to the user or simply apologise with humans somebody who ignores the feelings of others is not liked as much as somebody who shows some sort of emotional feedback why should it be different with computers says peter but sensing emotions from a person is not always easy current methods for collecting the data require researchers to wire users with electrodes and monitor their behaviour in a laboratory lessobtrusive means such as using a video to monitor gestures or a recorder to analyse voice allow the user to behave more naturally but the data can break down if the person moves too far away tuning in to your emotions peter and his team are working on technology that unobtrusively senses a persons emotions while they interact freely with a computer their latest prototype is a wireless electronic glove that measures heart rate blood pressure and skin temperature peter will be demonstrating the wireless glove at the cebit exhibition in hanover germany in march fraunhofer has been on the leading of edge of innovating says computer scientist professor rosalind picard of the massachusetts institute of technology information gathered by the glove is transmitted wirelessly to a base unit which stores it on a memory card or sends it to a computer database software written by peters team analyses the data and retrieves patterns that indicate certain emotions is that anger im sensing for example if a persons heart rate increases quickly and their skin temperature falls below a certain threshold it may indicate that they are angry a different combination of other variables suggests the person is slightly surprised or very surprised the fraunhofer team is also working on technology that will read facial features using an ordinary webcam the goal is to collect all the emotionindicating information in one database analyse it in real time and program the computer to respond immediately stem cell lines derived from abnormal embryos can improve our knowledge of genetic diseases researchers say australian researchers are seeking the countrys first licences to make stem cell lines from freshly created human embryos with genetic abnormalities this is a shift from the current situation where all research in australia on human embryos has been confined to frozen spare embryos created during previous invitro fertilisation ivf treatment the medical director of sydney ivf dr robert jansen says the group has applied to the national health and medical research councils licensing committee for two licences for fresh embryos one relates to embryos created during ivf but having genetic diseases like huntingtons cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy the second licence is for ivf embryos that have failed to develop properly and contain chromosomal abnormalities or mutations both the new licences are to intentionally produce abnormal stem cell lines so that they can be used for research into the relevant diseases jansen says dr david cram of monash ivf and his colleague stem cell pioneer professor alan trounson are also seeking access to embryos with genetic diseases we are going through a process at the moment to gain approval for using embryos that are being found to be affected by genetic disease for creating stem cell lines cram says the whole idea is that we believe that these stem cell lines will be useful in ultimately identifying new treatments for patients to identify a potential drug to change the abnormality fresh or frozen the use of fresh embryos was addressed by the stem cell and cloning legislation review committee which handed down its report last december about changes to current stem cell research laws the lockhart report recommends that fresh art assisted reproductive technology embryos that are diagnosed by preimplantation genetic diagnosis as being unsuitable for implantation should be permitted to be used under licence for research training and improvements in clinical practice cram says legislative changes will be required before researchers can have access to fresh as opposed to frozen embryos however jansen says the restrictions on using fresh embryos are not enshrined in law but are only a suggestion of the australian health ethics committee which stipulates a twoweek waiting period before a couple commits an embryo to research the timeframe effectively rules out the use of fresh embryos which would be too old to use for stem cells after two weeks preimplantation genetic diagnosis the abnormal embryos the researchers are seeking will be the products of preimplantation genetic diagnosis pigd which allows scientists to detect abnormalities in a blastocyst before its implanted in the womb in a paper published in the journal endocrine reviews trounson reviews the use of chromosomally abnormal or mutant human embryos from ivf clinics using pigd these lines are an important resource for functional genomics drug screening and perhaps eventually cell and gene therapy he writes cram says its also more efficient to use fresh embryos because freezing can damage them he says the group will also apply to import stem cell lines created from abnormal embryos internationally to cover all our bases in case the application for a licence is unsuccessful ethical issues associate professor sue dodds from the university of wollongong specialises in feminist approaches to bioethics she says the biggest ethical issues about using fresh embryos relate to the potential to put pressure on women to provide embryos on demand for research rather than creating them as part of a legitimate ivf process she says there are also perceptions about the socalled slippery slope towards productionline approaches to human life as a matter of public policy its been decided that we cannot create embryos for the purpose of research but can only use ones that would otherwise be destroyed because theyre not being used for ivf she says ice crystals from cirrus storm clouds can regenerate say scientists who have caught them on film cirrus clouds dont just form and die but can regenerate detailed images of ice crystals show the pictures are some of the first results to come out of the tropical warm pool international cloud experiment being conducted from darwin by the australian bureau of meteorology and international researchers the information will improve our understanding of the life cycle of these highaltitude clouds and help us to make better predictions about climate change the scientists say us researcher dr jim mather from the pacific northwest national laboratory says its been speculated that cirrus clouds can regenerate but the latest images have caught them in the act in older clouds the ice crystals are small and pristine which suggests they are newly formed in older cirrus the crystals are actually being regenerated he says theyre growing fresh crystals so while the cloud appears to be a continuous sheet extending well out from the storm theres actually a life cycle within the cloud thin and wispy cirrus clouds are the most common highaltitude cloud and can be found at altitudes of kilometres from the surface of the earth they can form sheets of up to kilometres across at temperatures between deg and degc these thin and wispy clouds are made of tiny ice particles they are a byproduct of storms lasting up to hours afterwards mather says cirrus clouds are an important factor in climate change because of the role they play in the interchange of solar energy between space and the earth if temperatures increase what will be the effect on these clouds will they increase or decrease in area or extent because that can have an effect in either warming or cooling the climate he says the images confirm that at higher altitudes there are some very small spherical particles about micrometres in diameter more complex crystalline shapes were found at lower altitudes at the base of the cloud mather says scientist have been discussing what shape ice crystals you might find at very high altitudes and very low temperatures theres been an expectation that if you look at a freshly produced cloud from a thunderstorm its going to be quite complex as the particles crash into each other and form large aggregate chains but as you get well away from the storm you expect to get more pristine crystals actually seeing these images and confirming the ideas was really an epiphany australian women should be given the option of taking a pill to terminate a pregnancy advocates of the ru drug say but not everyone agrees the abortion drug ru is not like most drugs that chug through australias regulatory system rarely has the availability of a drug been tied to such charged emotions including headlines that warn of backyard miscarriages for desperate women part of the debate which is due to come to a head in a parliamentary vote later this week relates to the drugs safety and efficacy does ru otherwise known as mifeprex or mifepristone have sideeffects and how does it compare with surgical abortions under the current system the conservative catholic antiabortion health minister tony abbott has the final say on the drug but advocates of ru say that decision should rest solely with health experts at the therapeutic goods administration as it does for other drugs in australia heated debate ru was developed in france in the s and is used for terminating a pregnancy at less than nine weeks sexual health and family planning australia says ru has been used by more than million women around the world and is available in countries including the uk us new zealand france sweden greece and spain the drug works by blocking the effects of the hormone progesterone which a woman needs to start and maintain a pregnancy it breaks down the lining of the uterus which can no longer hold onto the fertilised egg usually the woman has to return to her doctor two days later for a prostaglandin a drug that causes her uterus to contact and expel the products of conception how safe is it associate professor anne tonkin a clinical pharmacologist from the university of adelaide and a drug adviser to the federal government says mifepristone is not a risky drug and is not a particular threat to womens safety it is not a poison or a toxin and has very few sideeffects it works by mimicking a common cause of natural miscarriage the sideeffects are the same as those of a spontaneous natural abortion and include bleeding as part of the normal response she says that in of cases a miscarriage induced by mifepristone used in combination with a prostaglandin requires no further treatment in about as is the case for natural miscarriage a minor surgical procedure is required to complete the abortion this means that of women who would otherwise have required an operative procedure could avoid it with the use of mifepristone she says but a study that looked at all sideeffects of the drug reported to the us food and drug administration over a fouryear period found there were serious effects these included four otherwise healthy women who had died from bleeding or septic shock after taking the drug the most common sideeffects reported by all women of the adverse events analysed in the february issue of the annals of pharmacotherapy there were women who reported foetal abnormalities that appeared after failed abortion attempts ruptured ectopic pregnancies and allergic reactions emergency access chief medical officer professor john horvath has been concerned about the risks of later sideeffects in some women who take the drug in written advice to the health minister on the safety for women in remote areas he says ru carries a significantly higher risk than surgical abortion of later adverse events and he says that if doctors are not supported by services that could deal with emergency complications out of hours this would substantially increase the risks to women undergoing termination another recent study published in the journal contraception concludes the safety of mifepristone is high when it analysed the results from more than ru abortions in the us it found few serious medical complications in everyday use some per women had a complication most commonly heavy bleeding and per women died after taking the drug by comparison the mortality rate from surgical abortion was per women others have argued that rather than debating which abortion method is best the aim of the current debate is to offer women a choice the royal australian and new zealand college of obstetricians and gynaecologists for instance argues that ru should be an option many politicians are yet to reveal whether they back availability of ru so it is unclear which way parliament will vote but debate on the drug is likely to continue

worlds best examples of sympatric speciation when two species from a single ancestor form in the absence of a geographical barrier has been found among the swaying palm trees on australias lord howe island researchers have found two sister species of palms living side by side on the tiny world heritage listed island kilometres off australias east coast the two species the kentia or thatch palm howea forsteriana and curly palm h belmoreana appear to have diverged after they began flowering at different times of year probably as a result of differing soil preferences the international team of researchers including those from the uks royal botanic gardens kew reports its findings online today in the journal nature its generally accepted that evolution occurs by one species breaking into two by the process of allopatric speciation this might occur when say a mountain range separates a species and the two populations change gradually until they become so different they can no longer interbreed but there are also theoretical reasons to believe that a species can split into two within its own area a phenomenon known as sympatric speciation the researchers used a range of techniques to show that the palm species are sisters and indeed diverged much more recently than the islands creation by volcanic activity million years ago they calculate that the palms common ancestor probably arrived from mainland australia as long as million years ago and more recently h forsteriana diverged from its related species an ancestor of h belmoreana soil is the key they note that the flowering times of the palm trees differed on different soils indicating the ancestors of the two species may have adapted to different soil types they add that perhaps living on those different soil types modified the palm trees flowering times reducing their chance of interbreeding thats probably what kickstarted the speciation process and resulted in them finally being two separate species says associate professor david rowell from the australian national university canberra this paper is very clever because it uses lord howe island which is very small and where it is very unlikely that a species would be split into two and so therefore it seems to be very strong evidence that sympatric speciation has occurred in this case that being the case it lends strength to the models hypotheses and theories that people have put up about how evolution works fishy clues to new species meanwhile german researchers have discovered another case of apparent sympatric speciation this time in two species of fish in lake apoyo crater in nicaragua a report in todays nature says the lake is just kilometres across and less than years old but dna profiling shows that during that time it was colonised by the species amphilophus citrinellus which gave rise to a zaliosus this owlet nightjar is one of the species found in the lost world of west papua a world where animals show no fear of humans the lost world largely untouched by humans that was recently unearthed on west papua may be the last such find on earth an expedition scientist says his comments follow the discovery of a world teeming with new species giant flowers and rare wildlife showing no fear of humans australian us and indonesian scientists led by conservation international ci say they found the hectare paradise in the foja mountains of the indonesiancontrolled province during an expedition late last year the local kwerba and papasena people who are customary landowners of the forest acted as guides and naturalists the first bird i saw when i got out of the helicopter turned out to be a new species of honeyeater says team member kris helgen the bird was an orangefaced honeyeater a bird with a bright orange facepatch helgen who is completing a phd under dr tim flannery of the south australian museum says the honeyeater is the first new species of bird found in new guinea since seeing that as the first bird was the clue that we were onto something big he says the team also captured the first photos of the male berlepschs sixwired bird of paradise parotia berlepschi in its natural habitat this bird was one of a number first collected in the late th century by indigenous hunters and sent to victorian england where it was described as being of unknown location several subsequent expeditions failed to find the bird its definitely an area of great biological novelty says helgen there are lots of things found in these mountains that are found nowhere else the team took the first photos of the goldenfronted bowerbird amblyornis flavifrons displaying at its bower a tower of twigs and other forest materials it builds for the mating ritual the bowerbird like the bird of paradise had been collected in victorian times but no one knew where it came from in university of californias professor jared diamond was the first to demonstrate that the foja mountains was the true homeland of the bowerbird a lost world helgen says while diamond made observations of a number of birds in the foja mountains he did not collect data or specimens we were the first to mount the true scientific expedition he says helgen says apart from the reports from diamond there is no evidence that humans have ever been to the mountain range even the locals who took part in this latest research had never been there the researchers say the area is probably a or day walk from the nearest village not only are there no people but there are no things that people bring with them rats dogs pigs says helgen adding these animals affect native fauna it is a world thats been lost elsewhere he says much of the world would have looked like that at some point whats so interesting and unique is that it might be last time this is ever done high adventure true exploration of a place where no one has set foot hardly animals without fear for people the team also found mammals that show no fear of humans for example they were able to pick two longbeaked echidnas a primitive egglaying mammal that had been hunted to near extinction elsewhere the animals there just dont know people because people have never lived here thats a very very rare thing in this day and age says helgen the team also found a goldenmantled tree kangaroo dendrolagus pulcherrimus which had previously only been found on a single mountain in neighbouring papua new guinea and they found new species of plants including the largest rhododendron flower on record almost centimetres across more than new frogs and four new butterflies pretty impressive dr ken aplin an evolutionary biologist who specialises in mammals of australia and new guinea describes the find as pretty impressive and agrees the remoteness of the foja mountains explains why it is in such pristine condition people will generally hunt within a days travel of the village says aplin of csiro sustainable ecosystems currently based at the kyoto university museum in japan aplin says mountain ranges such as foja originally started life as a series of oceanic islands off to the north of new guinea which over time came closer and closer to the main central range and connected up in the past million years so they were evolving their own faunas prior to becoming part of new guinea he says other ranges along the north coast the foja range would have evolved unique species too he says but their biodiversity would have been affected by humans feral pigs and dogs in a global context it may well be unique or very nearly so in being one of the last places that is not showing any impact at all of human activities the expedition was cosponsored by the indonesian institute of science lipi and received funding from the swift foundation the gordon and betty moore foundation the national geographic society and the global environment project institute this dinosaur guanlong wucaii lived millions of years before trex and is the oldest tyrannosaur ever found it had an oddlooking crest and long arms but a fossil dug up in a remote chinese desert is the earliest example yet found of a tyrannosaur scientists report the creature named guanlong wucaii lived million years ago more than million years before tyrannosaurus rex it shows the tyrannosaur family had an extensive history the researchers report in todays issue of the journal nature guanlong is the oldest and most primitive tyrannosaur says professor james clark of george washington university who helped to lead the study t rex the bestknown tyrannosaur lived million to million years ago during the cretaceous period this latest find is million years older it is really pushing the record of tyrannosaurs back into the jurassic clark says clarks team found two examples of the early tyrannosaur in the junggar basin in northwestern china a largely unexplored cold desert back in the jurassic the area would have been a large wetland bounded by mountains says geologist dr david eberth of the royal tyrell museum in alberta canada it would have been warm with sporadic volcanic explosions he says these animals were found in mud rock says eberth adding the deposits were made of sand clay and volcanic material that secured the fossilised bones for millennia the wind has now eroded the dried deposits of tens of millions of years it is very easy to see what is in the rocks what is coming out of the rocks clark says the researchers camp out in the desolate region in the summers working between sandstorms they hire local people to walk across the rocks systematically searching for protruding fossils sharp teeth it was one such employee who spotted a bit of guanlong sticking out and eventually the palaeontologists dug up two nearly complete skeletons one on top of another we knew right away that this was a theropod dinosaur clark says it had sharp teeth and clearly was a twolegged animal but one of the two specimens had an unusual thin crest on its head and there was a place on the second skull where one appeared to have been broken off its a very unusual skull with this crest coming off it clark says it doesnt immediately shout tyrannosaur when you first see it but other identifiers marked it as a tyrannosaur including distinctive structures in the pelvis the thin crest probably was used for display clark says it has been coloured red in the reconstruction although scientists have no idea what colour it would have been they have also given the animal bright purple feathers we have no evidence of feathers in this species clark says but there is evidence of feathers in another primitive tyrannosaur we are fairly confident that it did have feathers dr gregory erickson of florida state university studied the growth rings in the animals shin bones and determined that one specimen would have been about seven years old and thus a juvenile and the other a yearold adult the creatures were about metres long compared to t rex which reached lengths of metres they do not have t rexs shortened forelimbs the researchers led by dr xu xing of the institute of vertebrate palaeontology and palaeoanthropology at the chinese academy of sciences in beijing named the new dinosaur guanlong wucaii the genus name is derived from the mandarin word for crowned dragon and species name refers to the region where it was found be careful what you wish for this valentines day french kissing puts teens at greater risk of contracting meningococcal disease than their lippecking counterparts uk research shows while intimate kissing with multiple partners appears to increase the risk of contracting the disease the uk study found that recently attending a religious event was associated with a low risk the study published this week in the british medical journal involved about teenagers aged to who had been admitted to hospital with a meningococcal infection lead researcher professor robert booy codirector of australias national centre for immunisation research and surveillance at the childrens hospital at westmead says that the microbes that we normally carry in our throats are readily transmitted to another person through intimate kissing for meningococcal disease this is the bacteria neisseria meningitidis infection can lead to blood poisoning meningococcal septicaemia inflammation of the outer lining around the brain and spinal cord meningococcal meningitis or a combination of the two when microbes that cause meningitis are transferred from one person to another the bodys immune system is normally able to repel them and they dont do any harm he says but if by chance you have a sore throat because of a smoky atmosphere or an existing virus the inflammation in your throat disrupts the protective epithelial membrane this makes it easy for the meningococcal microbes to pass through the lining of the throat into the blood stream and travel up to the brain where they cause meningitis but teens who avoid smoky parties and dont kiss with a sore throat may still be at high risk the study suggests university students are a highrisk group the study shows as are teens who were born preterm or who had glandular fever substance misuse was another highrisk behaviour our research suggests that vaccination is still the most effective way to reduce the risk of meningococcal disease but behavioural changes remain important because the vaccines available dont protect against all causes of meningococcal diseases booy says he speculates that teens with a religious lifestyle may have fewer opportunities to exchange saliva thus putting them at low risk of the disease believers might prefer to account for this particular finding as the power of prayer or it could be that the nonchurch goers lied about their kissing activities he says the nearby supernova a in its dying moments milliseconds before a giant star dies in a spectacular explosion it hums a note around middle c astronomers say in the april issue of the astrophysical journal professor adam burrows of the university of arizona and team will report the song that immediately precedes the explosion of a supernova we were quite sure when we started seeing this phenomenon that we were seeing sound waves but it was so unexpected that we kept rechecking and retesting our results says burrows astronomers have long been trying to understand what happens when a supernova a massive star collapses and explodes once it reaches deaths door a supernovas core is so dense that it does not allow energy to escape and the star collapses inwards towards the core until now scientists had assumed that the spectacular explosion in a stars dying moments was due to the stars outer shell bouncing back off the core but says australian supernova expert dr stuart ryder of the angloaustralian observatory in sydney none of the models of exploding supernovae to date have supported this theory basically the models dont show enough energy coming from the core bounce to overcome the collapsing outer layers the stuff trying to expand would keep running into the stuff that is still collapsing and it would literally stall the explosion says ryder there have been various attempts to tweak the models including taking account of neutrinos which are emitted from supernovae but scientists found that these subatomic particles also do not provide enough energy to make the models work the models still stalled before the explosion sound waves provide missing link burrows and team have now developed computer models to simulate the events of a dying star from the collapse of the core through to the supernova explosion our simulations show that the inner core starts to execute pulsations says burrows they show that after about milliseconds after the core collapses the inner core begins to vibrate wildly and after or milliseconds this oscillation becomes so vigorous that it sends out sound waves in these computer runs these sound waves actually cause the star to explode not the neutrinos the researchers say typical sound frequencies in the inner core are about to hertz in the audible range around middle c a million steps the new models involve a million steps and simulate the full second between core collapse and explosion previous models which did not take into account sound waves had only one fifth the number of steps and simulate only the first few hundred milliseconds after core collapse ryder says burrows and team could have found the missing link in understanding what makes stars explode it seems that we havent properly allowed for these sound phenomena in the core of the star when it collapses he says this might be like the death knell or the last alarm bell that something bad is about to happen disabling a memory molecule in the brain lifts depression in mice as effectively as using antidepressants researchers say new fossils found in australia tell us that enormous snakes evolved from predatory lizards like goannas scientists say palaeontologist dr john scanlon describes the wellpreserved to millionyear old snake skulls from the riversleigh world heritage site in todays issue of the journal nature theres been quite a bit of controversy about what sort of lizards snakes evolved from says scanlon of the riversleigh fossils centre in mount isa he says one idea is that snakes evolved from small burrowing insecteating lizards that lost their legs and developed an elongated body another idea is that snakes evolved from relatively large predatory lizards such as goannas scanlon says he hopes the skulls from a now extinct snake known as yurlunggur will settle the debate on the evolution of snakes the structure of the jaws and face prove that yurlunggur an arnhem land aboriginal term for rainbow serpent is a very primitive snake says scanlon it has so many features in common with lizards rather than other modern snakes for example yurlunggur has a clear jugal bone similar to a cheekbone not present in modern snakes and in particular the skulls show the snake is more closely related to large predatory lizards than to smaller insectivorous ones says scanlon it basically shows a relationship between the most primitive snakes and the varanoid lizards such as goannas and mosasaurs he says referring to the giant acquatic goannas that lived during the cretaceous period the galaxy cluster abell is composed of thousands of galaxies shown in this xray image and an amount of dark matter equivalent to more than a hundred trillion suns dark matter particles are zooming around the universe a million times faster than anyone predicted uk astronomers say theyve calculated that this mysterious substance which governs how stars and galaxies move is moving at a speedy kilometres per second the university of cambridge researchers have also worked out how dark matter likes to clump together and surprising details of how hot it is data essential in modelling how galaxies form a preliminary report is available on arxiv the online website operated by cornell university dark matter is mysterious because it doesnt emit radiation making it difficult to spot indeed noone has detected it and not all scientists are convinced it exists the best evidence for dark matter is that there are stars in our sky says professor gilmore director of the institute of astronomy at cambridge which made the latest calculations without it theyd be flying off into space dark matter is the mass needed to hold stars in their given places as they move around galaxies the faster they move the more mass is needed kepler and newton were able to weigh the sun just by knowing where earth was and how fast it was moving says gilmore we did the same thing only in three dimensions finding the weight of dark matter by measuring the place and speed of a very large number stars in several dwarf galaxies orbiting the milky way hanging out in clumps the results were surprising aside from their speed the researchers calculated the smallest clump of dark matter that could exist lightyears across these results imply that dark matter is hotter than predicted meaning that what astronomers call cold dark matter may not be so cold after all at degc its still cool by astronomical standards but its warm enough to solve two problems that have plagued standard models of how galaxies form that there are too few dwarf galaxies and why dark matter has not concentrated in the centre of galaxies gilmore says he was initially wary of the results which together seemed too simple to be plausible the discovery of a superdim galaxy by dr beth willman from new york university gave the team an opportunity to successfully test its predictions friendship may be just as important to some primates as it is for humans new research suggests female baboons that suffer the loss of a close friend or relative turn to other baboons for comfort and support according to a new study the study encompasses years of observing over freeranging baboons in botswanas okavango delta it provides the first direct evidence that certain animals mourn the loss of individuals even when the rest of their social group remains intact the findings also suggest that friendship may be just as important to some primates as it is for humans researchers were particularly struck by the behaviour of one female chacma baboon papio hamadryas ursinus named sylvia she was described as the queen of mean and disdainful of other baboons until she lost her daughter sierra to a lion kill in the week after sierra died sylvia was withdrawn says dr anne engh who led the project when the other females were grooming and socialising she tended to sit alone and rarely interacted even with her other relatives engh a postdoctoral researcher in the department of biology at the university of pennsylvania adds after a week or two of moping around sylvia suddenly initiated grooming with several lowranking females i think that they were as surprised as i was they seemed awfully nervous at first eventually sylvia settled into close relationships with a very lowranking female and with sierras daughter margaret relieving stress engh says that grooming is a friendly behaviour similar to two human friends chatting over a drink the activity seems to relax the participants to the point where it can lower stress hormone levels those levels rise in humans and baboons after a close friend or relative dies the researchers measured a group of such hormones called glucocorticoids in sylvia and other females baboons that experienced losses had elevated levels of the hormones after the deaths in humans this is associated with bereavement so it is likely that baboons also grieve their dead the mourning animals then widened their social circles by approaching and grooming other females even those that were beneath them in rank this appeared to help them cope with losses since stress hormone levels significantly dropped afterwards the discovery outlined in a recent proceedings of the national academy of sciences paper underscores the importance of friendship humans and baboons who are more socially integrated have lower glucocorticoid levels says engh both the human research and our results highlight the importance of friendly social relationships in reducing stress female baboons usually have one or two close female friends that usually devote a large proportion of their grooming to each other and they seem to enjoy spending time close together engh also mentions that friendships form between male and female baboons for those relationships the female often grooms the male while the male protects the female and any infants that she might have from predation and bullying baboons no surprise there brian craft lead keeper at the oakland zooin california says that he was not surprised by the findings advanced relationships are seen in chimpanzees bonobos as well as baboons and other multisocial troops craft explains friendships which may help to ease stress after deaths can be beneficial to the troop as a whole as they keep it cohesive it also appears that friend selection among baboons and other primates is somewhat of a choice as for humans and is not just instinctive behaviour simulation of small satellite galaxies orbiting and falling into a larger one astronomers have released new evidence to show that a region of stars in our galaxy known as the arcturus stream is the digested remains of what was once a neighbouring galaxy the evidence is among the first to come from the largest star study to date with data from stars just released at a us astrophysics workshop dr quentin parker of sydneys macquarie university and the angloaustralian observatory is head of data management at the international radial velocity experiment or rave which uses australias uk schmidt telescope parker says the latest results provide a smoking gun for the argument that the milky way is a voracious cannibal that devours its neighbours weve confirmed the arcturus moving group as being a star stream which indicates a disruptive galaxy spiralled into our own he says ours is a large galaxy and it has been eating other galaxies its been hungry we can see what its eaten by the crumbs that are left over from its meal its another bit of evidence for the now widely accepted cannibal or accretion theory of galactic evolution parker says according to this theory the gravitational pull of large galaxies sucks in smaller ones making large galaxies like our own a sort of cosmic melting pot parker says the rave measurements show stars in the arcturus group are travelling at a similar velocity and in a similar direction through space indicating they were once part of a coherent system using star velocities its possible for the first time begin to unravel the way our galaxy is constructed he says the rave study is measuring the speed of a million stars in the milky way using radial velocity or the motion of a star along the line of sight between the telescope and the star the huge scope of the survey has been made possible by the six degree field df spectrograph on the metre uk schmidt telescope at the angloaustralian observatory which can obtain spectroscopic information for up to stars at once the telescope splits light from the stars into a wide spectrum of colours and by looking at specific colours produced by calcium atoms astronomers can work out whether the colours have shifted in the spectrum this enables them to work out aspects of the stars movement were looking at the stars in our galaxy and measuring their velocity by measuring how their lines have shifted parker says the survey has so far collected information about stars and will release data on the remaining as its analysed the cane toad front is moving across australia five times faster than it was in the s the invasion of the dreaded cane toad across australia has taken a new turn with research showing the toxic toads are evolving longer legs that allow them to move faster this means they can encroach even faster on new territory biologists say in todays issue of the journal nature cane toads bufo marinus were introduced to australia more than years ago to control insect pests in cane fields and their toxic nature and invasiveness have made them a major ecological menace the toads have expanded to cover more than a million square kilometres of the continent and are now progressing at a rate five times higher than in the s to s professor richard shine from the university of sydney and team stationed themselves at the invasion front kilometres east of darwin they then waited for the toads which can travel almost two kilometres a night to arrive measurements revealed that the super athletes at the front of the pack had longer legs than those at the back why are their legs longer shine says there are two possible and probable explanations as to why toads at the front have longer legs the first is the conventional evolutionary reason that there are advantages to being at the front toads with longer legs have the first access to virgin territory full of juicy grubs so the evolving species is favouring this characteristic the second explanation is more immediate and practical these guys sort themselves out spatially because the only ones that can be at the front are the fast ones says shine put simply if the faster ones with the longest legs were at the back they would trample the shorter slower ones ahead so even if there is no evolutionary advantage to being at the front you are still going to end up with the front guys being the fast movers he says understanding the enemy shine says understanding the enemy is the first step in combating the toads in the future people tend to take a very straightforward view that cane toads are bad and we just have to work out ways to kill lots of them but history is telling us that that doesnt work that well he says what we need to do is find what kind of animal toads really are what bits of the landscape they use how they use it and what they depend on a new type of pulsar that spits out radio waves intermittently rather than regularly has been discovered scientists have discovered a strange new type of pulsar that emits intermittent bursts of radio waves and there are lots of them out there in a paper in the journal nature today an international team of astronomers estimates there could be up to half a million of these weird flashing dead stars the scientists are calling them rrats or rotating radio transients unlike ordinary pulsars which can emit regular pulses of radio waves rrats emit short millisecond bursts of radio waves in between dark spells that may last several hours this makes them very difficult to find says coauthor dr dick manchester from csiros australia telescope national facility who has been hunting pulsars with the parkes radio telescope for the past seven years these things are so sporadic that most searches like the survey we conducted would have missed them we only looked at each patch of the sky for minutes so we were lucky to find any he says this means there must be a huge population out there many more than ordinary pulsars while there are about ordinary pulsars in the milky way astronomers estimate there are at least rrats this latest research could mean that scientists will have to come up with new ideas for the way so many rrats have formed birth of a pulsar pulsars are believed to be formed in supernovae the cataclysmic explosion that signals the end of the life of a massive star as the core collapses to a superdense neutron star it spins very rapidly sending a beam of radiation that sweeps out like a searchlight if the beam is pointing towards earth each pulse can be detected hence the name pulsar we knew that rrats were pulsars even though the pulses were isolated just a single burst and then they might shut up for an hour or two says manchester but it was only by timing them over a four year period that it was realised that they had much longer periods than normal and that they were slowing down magnetic reborn or just plain weird the paper suggests that rrats are young super magnetic pulsars barely years old but manchester is not ruling out the possibility that they may be zombies old pulsars suddenly brought back to life by growing magnetic fields or ordinary pulsars radiating in an unusual way thats what makes it exciting he says there are so many possibilities women value a good sense of humour in a potential male partner even if his jokes are crass but men dont rate humour so highly in women new research shows its a trait often requested in lonely hearts ads and scientists have now shown that a good sense of humour is important for women but not men in choosing a romantic partner a woman is even willing to overlook other shortcomings in a man if he can make her laugh north american researchers say in the journal evolution and human behavior our results suggest that humour can positively affect desirability as a relationship partner but this effect is most likely to occur when men use humour and are evaluated by women says dr eric bressler an assistant professor at westfield state college in massachusetts bressler and canadian researcher dr sigal balshine an assistant professor at mcmaster university in ontario demonstrated in an experiment that a good sense of humour or gsoh as it appears in personal ads does make a difference they showed groups of women pictures of two equally attractive men and presented autobiographical statements that were either funny or serious after reversing the experiment and showing groups of men photographs of two women they asked both sexes to select who they would choose as a romantic partner the humorous people were seen as more socially adept but less trustworthy honest and intelligent men did not select the funny person but women did women chose funny men as relationship partners despite often rating them as less honest and intelligent the researchers say funny men were preferred even if their humour was unsophisticated the researchers add can censoring scientists be justified no according to the csiro scientists who say theyve been banned from talking to the public about aspects of climate change allegations the australian government has pressured some of its top scientists to keep quiet about the implications of climate change are just the tip of the iceberg of scientific censorship commentators say according to the claims aired on abc tvs four corners program last night senior csiro scientists drs graeme pearman barney foran and barrie pittock were regularly gagged from commenting on socalled policy issues such as greenhouse gas emission targets and environmental refugees but at least one expert says there are times where government censorship of scientific research is justified and may be necessary dr michael selgelid who lecturers in bioethics at the university of sydney questions whether scientists should be able to publish research that could endanger the public for example information that could be used to make nuclear weapons is censored and weve been living with that for the last years he says he says governments should similarly be able to block publication of research that provides information about making biological weapons if someone discovers an easy way of making something thats just as dangerous and contagious as smallpox there would be really good grounds for censoring it despite the fact that free speech is important and that scientific openness is important he disagrees with suggestions that it should be a matter for journals to censor what they publish or for scientists to censor themselves scientists just dont have that kind of expertise and sometimes its only the government thats going to have the information thats needed to do the risk assessment he says vested interests censorship is a different matter when it comes to the influence of vested interests says brian martin an associate professor in science technology and society at the university of wollongong who has published articles on the suppression of dissent in science he says this form of censorship is alive and well in australia in all my studies the thing that stands out is that a few cases that have become prominent but for every one of those theses at least maybe as many as other cases which never receive any publicity he says dr mark diesendorf is a former csiro chief scientist and is now a senior lecturer in environment studies at the university of new south wales he accuses csiro of gagging him during the s and s when he was involved in renewable energy research he says history is repeating itself with the latest allegations and with csiros recent decision to move away from renewable energy research everyone at csiro is terrified the federal government will cut their budget unless they do exactly as theyre told that and suppression of the atmospheric research scientists is well know to us who work in the energy policy field he says a spokeswoman for csiro declined to comment saying i dont think we can possibly comment on something that happened years ago she also describes diesendorfs comments on a fear of budget cuts as absolute rubbish withholding funding diesendorf says withholding funding is another form of censorship with many research grants now subject to ministerial approval and what he describes as unequal funding for cooperative reserch centres crcs there are three crcs for fossil fuels and zero for renewable energy he says research development for solar energy has shrunk and there is no funding for windpower diesendorf says hes particularly worried about what he describes as the blatant muzzling of scientists he says this means we risk policy decisions being made by vested interests such as big business the military and powerful professions scientists are people who have expert knowledge so it means that policy decisions are made without expert knowledge or by the expert knowledge of vested interests only he says the very least we can expect in a democracy is that all sides have a right to present evidence thats relevant to policy martin says we should be very worried about scientific censorship because it can affect human life with climate change were talking about risk to future generations its something that society should be paying attention to it should be put on the agenda without fear or favour but censorship doesnt appear to be a universal experience for scientists i have never been gagged about what i say to the media says monash universitys professor patricia vickersrich in a response to a poll by the australian science media centre this is not a problem for this scientist and that relates not only to issues on climate change but also on issues relating to intelligent design population aids and i am frequently vocal on these issues babies have an innate ability to do simple maths while counting toes is beyond them then can match voices to the number of people in a room even before babies learn to talk they have a bit of a grasp of maths according to new research concluding that infants may have an abstract sense of numerical concepts the us research published in the latest issue of proceedings of the national academy of sciences says sevenmonthold babies demonstrate an ability to match the number of voices they hear to the number of faces they expect to see the study of infants by researchers at duke university was similar to a previous experiment to demonstrate that monkeys show numerical perception across senses in the new study babies listened either to two or three women simultaneously saying the word look at the same time the infants could choose between video images of two or three women saying the word as they had found with the monkeys the researchers say the babies spent significantly more time looking at the video image that matched the number of women talking as a result of our experiments we conclude that the babies are showing an internal representation of twoness or threeness that is separate from sensory modalities and thus reflects an abstract internal process writes researcher dr elizabeth brannon an assistant professor in psychological and brain sciences these results support the idea that there is a shared system between preverbal infants and nonverbal animals for representing numbers she says what we do know is that somehow very quickly the babies acquire this ability to perceive number and divorce it from the sensory information understanding the research could be useful in devising methods for teaching basic maths skills to the very young brannon says the hormonal changes that teenage girls go through when they start their periods may explain why they have trouble sleeping adolescent girls appear to be at greater risk of insomnia after they begin menstruation a study has found this suggests that hormonal changes play a role in developing the sleep disorder the researchers say in the journal pediatrics researchers found that among more than to yearolds in the study nearly had suffered insomnia at some point insomnia based on formal clinical criteria was defined as problems falling asleep or staying asleep at least four times a week for a month or longer typically the study found the teens started having sleep disturbances around the age of before menstruation girls were about as likely as boys to have insomnia but after they began their menstrual periods girls had more than twice the risk of insomnia as boys the findings suggest that the hormonal changes that come with menstruation contribute to girls insomnia risk according to the authors such a physiological reason is one of two broad explanations for why menstruation would be related to insomnia says lead author dr eric johnson the other possibility is that the physical changes that come with puberty like breast development create social pressures that contribute to sleep problems says johnson a researcher with rti international but he says menstruation is related specifically to problems with staying asleep and getting enough deep sleep these forms of insomnia are more likely to have physiological causes whereas problems with falling asleep in the first place can often be stressrelated in addition girls higher risk of insomnia was not explained by higher rates of depression which is often marked by sleep disturbances a long lasting problem another key finding johnson says is that of all teens who ever suffered insomnia also had symptoms at the time of the study this he says signals that the problem is lasting for many teenagers insomnia seems to be common and chronic among adolescents johnson and his colleagues conclude given the consequences of sleep deprivation among teenagers including blunted mental acuity poorer school performance and even poorer physical and emotional health prevention and treatment may need to become important priorities the researchers say therapies for insomnia include lifestyle changes to promote sleep like getting to bed and rising at regular times each day cognitive behavioral therapy and sleep medications a voodoo follower at an international celebration of voodoo spirituality in the west african country of benin earlier this year priests who tear out the throats of live chickens in ritual sacrifices to voodoo gods may risk contracting bird flu now the deadly virus has reached africa voodoo priests in benin which borders nigeria where an outbreak of the deadly hn virus was found in poultry last week sacrifice animals to invoke blessings or favours from the gods officials in the tiny west african country which is the home of the ancient religion say spreading the word about bird flu may help to save the lives of voodoo devotees we have identified the groups at risk including fetishists and followers of the voodoo cult who sometimes kill animals with their teeth says guillaume hounsouve director of livestock at benins agriculture ministry sheep goats and other animals are sometimes sacrificed but the favourite offering is a chicken priests commonly kill birds by ripping their throats out with their teeth or using a knife to cut their heads off both methods would bring them into contact with chicken blood one of the ways bird flu is thought to be spread to humans the disease has killed more than people in asia and turkey since hounsouve and other senior officials in benin have spent the past few days drafting an action plan to counter bird flu we will target our messages above all in regions where there are convents says hounsouve referring to the houses used for voodoo rituals a common practice an estimated of benins million people practise voodoo although many also follow other religions like christianity or islam voodoo convents are found across benin but more commonly in southern areas near the atlantic seaboard once known as the slave coast many thousands of africans were shipped from here by european traders during more than three centuries of slave trading many took their voodoo beliefs with them to the new world notably haiti where rites and traditions from different parts of africa met and evolved voodoo in west africa and the caribbean encompasses a wide range of rituals from sacrificing animals to dancing in which devotees fall into trances said to be a form of possession by gods is the court making different rules for copyright protection in the online world record companies are being given the power to veto the design of new digital communication technologies say advocates of online civil liberties the claim by electronic frontiers australia efa comes on the eve of an appeal against a landmark ruling last year against providers of the internet filesharing software kazaa kazaa is one of a number of free software packages that allow people to swap files over the internet record companies complain that such peertopeer filesharing software leads to people illegally downloading their copyrighted music and last year they took the providers of kazaa software to the federal court of australia the court found the providers guilty of authorising copyright infringement by encouraging millions of users to download music from artists ranging from powderfinger and radiohead to christine anu and robbie williams the court also ordered the providers of kazaa to modify the software to contain filters that would make it difficult for users to search for copyrighted works specified by the record companies on monday february the providers of kazaa will appeal against this decision and the efa with the new south wales council for civil liberties and the australian consumers association is applying to take part in the appeal efa is also worried that this kazaa ruling could one day lead to email providers inappropriately monitoring filtering or blocking messages concerns record companies focus on the illegal uses of peertopeer filesharing software but efa is worried last years kazaa ruling and the order to modify the software will hinder people who want to use it legally it says filtering may catch files that are not infringing copyright for example music already in the public domain or music deliberately distributed free by independent music groups and efa also doesnt think record companies should be able to control the design of new digital communication technologies if this type of precedent is allowed to stand says efa vicechair dale clapperton its essentially going to give the record labels a veto power over the development of new technology the australian recording industry association aria disagrees noone who read the judgement could form this view an aria spokesperson says the operators of kazaa did not even suggest this aria also rejects claims that filters will stop legitimate downloads a wellconstructed filter that targets infringing files will have no effect on legitimate files on the kazaa system the aria spokesperson says a new precedent clapperton says last years kazaa ruling shows the court is treating online copyright infringement in a different way to past infringements he says when a court first found an australian university library guilty of authorising copyright infringement by allowing students to photocopy books it ruled that libraries should put up warning signs the court didnt ban the photocopiers it didnt order that the photocopiers should be modified to reduce the potential that they be used for infringing purposes says clapperton similarly he says video recorder were not banned when movie studios complained that they could be used to infringe copyright when taping television programs if theyd succeeded we wouldnt have video machines today and we would almost certainly not have things like ipods stifling innovation efa says its early days for digital communication software and if providers are made responsible for how their product is used this could reduce competition you could end up with a situation where the only people who produce products are the ones already tied in with the music labels says clapperton it really is going to stifle the development of new technologies aria rejects these claims there is no evidence that there is any reduction in competition or innovation following the decision says the spokesperson the opposite has happened with the launch of many more digital download services including itunes other possible impacts efa chair matt black is adamant the kazaa case should be overturned because the precedent could affect email providers instant messaging and even google black says software like gmail has the capacity for large files to be transferred via the internet and if the principle of the kazaa ruling is applied here you may see google which runs gmail filtering email then youre looking at a situation where very important communications are being monitored filtered and potentially blocked inappropriately by your email provider theres more to the flow of water down terraces like these than meets the mathematicians eye a mathematical equation that attempts to model the distribution of water in rice terraces has convinced one researcher that the western notion of maths has a lot to learn from other cultures mathematician willy alangui of the university of the philippines baguio spoke about his attempt to model rice terrace irrigation this week at the third international conference on ethnomathematics in auckland new zealand alangui has been studying irrigation in a network of rice paddy terraces built by the indigenous kankanaey people of the northern philippines im trying to understand how water is efficiently distributed in all the paddies says alangui the paddies are contained by stone walls and farmers ensure everyone gets enough water by opening and closing inlets and outlets as the water flows from the top terraces to the bottom alangui developed an equation to model the dynamics of water distribution the model took account of variables such as the amount of water flowing into the system the rate of evaporation and the size and elevation of the paddies for me as a mathematician it explained nicely the dynamics that goes on in the distribution of water in the whole network of paddies he says but when he went back to validate the variables he had used with the kankanaey people he found his model was seriously flawed it failed to account for one major factor that governs the kankanaey rice irrigation system the ethic of cooperation the social responsibility factor alangui found out the system depended on a notion of social responsibility even when water was scarce people upstream shared water equally with those downstream because they had helped to build the irrigation system in the first place this told him the system would fail if the paddy owner at the top of the hill took more water than was fair alangui says the failure of his model to capture the ethical dimension of the irrigation system told him that he needed to broaden his perspective as a mathematician in the phd thesis alangui will try and modify the model to include this ethic although he says it may not be possible my mathematics may be deficient he says its not the be all and end all of everything its just one way of looking at the world ethnomathematics alangui thinks western mathematics has a lot to learn from other cultures hence his interest in ethnomathematics the connections between mathematics and culture he says western mathematics has become powerful and arrogant as a field and marginalised other perspectives maori culture for example has a different concept of numbers says alangui while western culture uses the number three as an adjective in for example the phrase three glasses maori talk of glasses interacting with each other and as being in the act of threeing in kankanaey culture he says there is no concept of a circle as a static object defined by a centre and a radius rather there is the concept of encircling in which a circle is defined as point moving around a circumference alangui says mathematicians should ask why the static version of numbers or circles has come to dominate interrogating longheld assumptions like this could lead to different and useful concepts in maths he says he says hyperbolic and elliptic geometry were developed when mathematicians questioned the assumption of euclidian geometry that two parallel lines never meet alangui is a member of the kankanaey people and has a masters degree in pure maths light from saturns rings illuminates the storm where lightning strikes are more powerful than ones on earth for nearly a month a huge storm with massive lightning has been raging on saturn under the watchful eye of the cassini spacecraft it was a cassini ear a radio receiver that first detected the storm on january and this week scientists finally coaxed an image from cassinis camera sunlight reflecting off the planets rings provided enough light during the saturn night for cassinis camera to pick out the storm and cloud features researchers now are working hard to identify spots within the storm that could be lightning the only other place in the solar system besides earth where lightning has been positively identified is on jupiter cassinis radio detector is on all the time says planetary meteorologist professor andrew ingersoll with the california institute of technology and a member of the cassini science team months go by and there is no radio noise from saturn then all of a sudden in the space of a day they get it thats what happened on january the radio emissions are similar to the popping and crackling that you might hear if you were driving through a thunderstorm with an am radio on what is generally thought of as radio interference is actually radio waves generated by lightning behind the storm scientists are not sure what causes the lighting on saturn but they believe it is triggered by the same process that creates lightning on earth on earth we think the convection in thunderstorms is important in the process of separating positive charges from negative charges and if you separate enough charges you build up a very large potential field between those separated charges says university of iowas dr bill kurth the deputy principal investigator of cassinis radio and plasma wave science instrument nature doesnt like that and it tries to correct the situation by running a current between the two separated charges that forms a very large spark theres an awful lot of energy thats released and its meant to basically allow the negative charges and the positive charges to get back together again kurth says on saturn the phenomena manifests itself on a gigantic scale with lighting bolts more than times stronger than strikes on earth the radio data reveals the storm itself spans an area larger than continental us why saturn should have such massive storms is a mystery the planet gets only about of the sunlight that reaches earth so there is much less energy to drive storms ingersoll says given that there are two possibilities one is that you have the same number of storms that you have on earth but they are weaker or two they are just as strong but there are fewer while more studies are needed ingersoll favours the second explanation this storm certainly looks more vigorous and the radio emissions are more powerful deep down so there may be more water in the atmosphere than on earth ingersoll says amateurs beat the professionals the first images of the storm actually came from two groundbased amateur astronomers not the cassini spacecraft from its present orbital perch cassini has been unable to image the sunlit side of saturn the team studying the radio emissions however decided to ask the amateur astronomy community if anyone had any pictures of saturn that corresponded to where radio emissions were coming from within hours two astronomers near paris submitted the first visual confirmation of the storm their findings were confirmed by the cassini images shot in darkness with illumination from the planets rings buying a house new research shows its best for our unconscious to work on big decisions when faced with a major decision such as buying a car or a house its best to do your homework then forget about it for a while and let your unconscious churn through the options according to the results of a novel study published today in the journal science unconscious deliberation may lead to a more satisfying choice than mere conscious deliberation alone at least for major decisions conscious deliberation is fine for the less important more mundane everyday choices like deciding which shampoo or towels to buy but not for bigger decisions the report indicates four investigators in the department of psychology at the university of amsterdam confirm the value of what they call the deliberationwithoutattention hypothesis in a series of studies on consumer choice the did the experiments in the laboratory and in real life among shoppers in department stores decisions decisions for example in a carshopping experiment participants read a complex series of facts about cars they were thinking of buying immediately afterwards they were given puzzles to keep their conscious selves busy after working on the puzzles this group of shoppers reported greater satisfaction with their car choice than the people who were given no puzzles and had to decide which car to buy immediately after consciously pondering the facts but for making simple decisions such as choosing between different sets of towels conscious deliberations were all that was needed to make satisfying choices there are several possible reasons why conscious thought sometimes leads to poor judgment the researchers say consciousness has a low capacity causing individuals to consider only a subset of relevant information and they may inappropriately weight the importance or relevance of this information in contrast the human subconscious has a higher capacity to integrate more information which can lead to better choices first gather all the information the takehome message is that when you have to make a decision the first step should be to get all the information necessary for the decision says author dr ap dijksterhuis once you have the information you have to decide and this is best done with conscious thought for simple decisions but left to unconscious thought to sleep on it when the decision is complex the novel finding from these studies is the idea that we can think unconsciously and that unconscious thought is actually superior to conscious thought for complex decisions the researcher adds poultry farmers burn chicken carcasses in nigeria a country that has just started investigating suspected human cases of the hn bird flu virus now scientists are preparing for a worstcase scenario a human bird flu pandemic a human vaccine against the deadly hn strain of bird flu virus has successfully passed the first stages in testing its safety and effectiveness reports the manufacturer the trial carried out at the murdoch childrens research institute with the university of melbourne and the royal adelaide hospital recently tested a vaccine made by csl ltd of melbourne csl today announced that the vaccine triggered an immune response it predicts will equate with a good level of protection in about half of the healthy adult volunteers tested and says dr andrew cuthbertson csls chief scientific officer the participants got little more than the odd sore arm it was very reassuring in a safety sense the vaccine was based on a deactivated virus originally taken from a vietnamese patient it was then grown up in fertilised chicken eggs killed and mixed with an aluminium phosphate adjuvant before being given to volunteers cuthbertson says the trial found immune stimulation occurred at two antigen doses of microgram and two of micrograms although greater stimulation occurred at the double microgram dose which is the dose used in normal flu shots while it is generally assumed the higher the immune stimulation the greater the protection cuthbertson says no one knows yet precisely what immune level will protect further safety and efficacy studies csl says it now plans to organise a second trial to study the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine in other healthy volunteers in particular children and older people who respond differently to vaccines it also plans to test the impact of higher doses of vaccine to clarify the dose that gives the best immune response he hopes the vaccine could be registered some time in the first half of but says cuthbertson if the vaccine is eventually registered it will be a matter for governments and regulatory agencies to decide the lowest dose that can protect the most number of people how ready are we csl says if a bird flu pandemic arrived now and it was directed by the government to do so they would be able to produce the vaccine as it is in six weeks but if the pandemic strain mutated from the hn to a strain more readily transmitted to humans he says the time frame could be stretched if the virus was not too different we would proceed to crank out as much vaccine as possible of the one that we made already says cuthbertson if it was very different csl would have to switch to making a new vaccine and this would take another six weeks cuthbertson says registering a vaccine against the hn strain will still save time even if the eventual pandemic strain is different because the therapeutic goods administration has told csl it would not have to repeat clinical trials its making the assumption that the safety profile and so forth will be similar he says other trials while there have been many attempts to make a vaccine around the world there have been few results of clinical trials announced says professor aileen plant chief executive officer of the australian biosecurity cooperative research centre at curtin university and a consultant to the world health organization it is exciting really i dont think theres been anywhere else thats been able to get that sort of immunological response with two doses of micrograms says plant who also sits on the federal governments national influenza pandemic action committee she says a us trial last year that did not use an adjuvant had to give substantially more antigen to get an immune response which means fewer people could be vaccinated plant agrees that the vaccine could be used in an emergency despite the missing data on children and elderly people if the pandemic came tomorrow the risks would be so high that we would say that it was worth going with it even if we didnt have the data researchers have put insulin producing cells like this into tiny capsules as a treatment for type diabetes encapsulating insulin producing cells in tiny seaweed bubbles and injecting them into people with type diabetes could one day remove the need for daily insulin injections an australian researcher says professor bernie tuch of the university of new south wales launched a trial of the technology this week using capsules made from the seaweed derivative alginate and measuring just micrometres across tuch says if the trial works it will mean that insulin producing cells or islets can be transplanted effectively reversing type diabetes without the need for immunosuppressive drugs this is because the capsules protect the transplanted cells from being sought out and destroyed by the bodys immune system the capsules also contain tiny holes that let the insulin flow out while allowing oxygen and nutrients in the concept of the seaweed is that it forms a coating around the islets with holes that are small enough to prevent immune cells entering tuch says the trial involving a year woman who was diagnosed with type diabetes years ago is the first of its kind in australia tuchs team at the diabetes transplant unit at sydneys prince of wales hospital has previously tested the method in animals an italian group began a similar human trial two years ago but is using capsules made from a different material about capsules during mondays halfhour procedure the woman was injected with capsules containing a total of around islet cells the islets had been isolated from a cadaver and put into the capsules in a procedure tuch compares to blowing soap bubbles theres the alginate theres your cells and theres air he says you blow the air and the alginate and the cells together and its like blowing soap bubbles they come out with the cells inside the capsules the capsules were injected into the patients abdomen where its hoped they will start producing insulin within hours allowing her to slowly begin reducing her insulin injections tuch says one injection could potentially last a lifetime although its not yet known whether the current patient will need extra injections what could go wrong immunologist dr bronwyn obrien who is working with a team from the university of technology sydney to genetically engineer liver cells so they produce insulin says tuchs method is promising but may have complications in practice one of the big problems is that often islets that are in the centre of the capsule become hypoxic theyre not getting oxygen and they die she says the implications would be the cells would break up into possibly small enough pieces that could leave the capsule theres also a chance that immune cells could grow around the outside of the capsules blocking the flow of insulin she says and while the pores in the capsules are big enough to keep t cells and antibodies out theres still a chance that cytokines the socalled messengers of the immune system will slip through and produce an inflammatory response tuch acknowledges this risk and says the patient received antiinflammatory drugs as a precaution we dont anticipate there is going to be a major inflammatory response but if they do get in then the islets may be destroyed he says not just for diabetes the concept of microencapsulation as a means of avoiding rejection drugs could apply to any transplant involving cells tuch says and in particular stem cell therapies the concept of using capsules is certainly something that is reaching its clinical testing and time will tell what it has to offer he says the search for life on other planets is homing in on a handful of solar systems that resemble our own but not everyone agrees this is the best approach astronomers looking for extraterrestrial life now have a short list of places to point their telescopes they include nearby stars of the right size age and composition to have earthlike planets circling them scientists say but cuts in us federal funding mean that private philanthropists who pay for the bulk of their work may find out first when and if extraterrestrial life is discovered the astronomers told a meeting of the american association for the advancement of science dr margaret turnbull of the carnegie institution of washington released her top list of potential stars to the meeting they will be the first targets of nasas terrestrial planet finder a system of two orbiting observatories scheduled for launch by there are billion stars in the galaxy and obviously were not going to point the terrestrial planet finder at every one of them says turnbull so on behalf of nasa and the now independently funded search for extraterrestrial intelligence or seti she narrowed down the list to stars that could have planets with liquid water orbiting them we want to see these habitable planets with our own eyes she adds so the star cannot be too bright or it will obscure the planet variable stars which grow hotter and cooler probably would not be conducive to life so they are thrown out as are stars that are too young or too old some are too gassy to have spawned planets like earth which contains a lot of metal others have massive companions whose gravity could interfere with the steady conditions needed for life to evolve top list turnbulls top list includes pegasus where in swiss astronomers spotted the first planet outside our solar system a jupiterlike giant others include sco in the scorpio constellation which is very similar to the sun epsilon indi a a star onetenth as bright as the sun and alpha centauri b part of the closest solar system to our own the truth is when looking at these socalled habstars habitable solar systems it is hard to really rank them i dont know enough about every star to say which one is the absolute best one turnbull says but dr carol cleland of the university of colorado argues that astronomers are limiting themselves by looking for planets that closely resemble earth i actually think we ought to be looking for life as we dont know it cleland says she says life on earth is all so similar based on dna made up of specific building blocks that it is likely to have had a single origin life elsewhere may be built from different ingredients or structured very differently she says feeling the pinch dr jill tarter of the seti institute set up after us government funding for the program was cut says the current budget threatens other astronomical programs she says research and analysis budgets were cut by in the fiscal year budget proposed this year by us president george w bush in the case of astrobiology the cut is to of what it was in tarter says we are facing what we consider an extraordinarily difficult financial threat she says nasa once had a policy of what to do who to call and how to announce the news if someone detected a signal of intelligent life from space today it is in fact a group of very generous philanthropists who will get the call before we get a press conference tarter says they include microsoft cofounder paul allen and microsoft chief technology officer nathan myhrvold some children with autism really can empathise with others researchers say people with autism are more intelligent and able to function better than previously believed experts say but mistrust of doctors biased tests and the internet have bred myths about the condition at a meeting of the american association for the advancement of science researchers presented reports showing that even people with autism who do not speak can have aboveaverage intelligence they also offered additional studies disputing claims that vaccines can cause autism the current figures are that of autistic people are mentally retarded with the mute the most impaired says canadian researcher dr laurent mottron an autism researcher at montreals hocircpital riviegraveredesprairies but mottron believes the wrong intelligence tests are used to assess autistic children many are tested using the wechsler scale a common iq test that includes questions about words and concepts learned in school the ravens progressive matrices test measures abstract reasoning and consistently gives autistic children higher scores mottron says the average boost in score is points mottron says enough to put someone previously considered mentally retarded into the normal range and the average to gifted status mottron was so impressed by the abilities of one autistic student michelle dawson that he made her a coauthor of some of his papers autism is a term used to describe a broad range of symptoms from an inability to use language normally to exhibiting deeply disturbed and repetitive behaviours professor morton gernsbacher at the university of wisconsinmadison questioned a common idea among autism researchers that autistic people lack a theory of mind this among other things gives an ability to empathise with others again she says the wrong tests are used to assess this ability is there an autism epidemic dr judith grether a california epidemiologist says she questions the idea that there is a new autism epidemic she says it is impossible to find out how many cases of autism there were in the past because many people with autism were often diagnosed as retarded or never diagnosed without that information it is impossible to say if the number of cases has grown she says we have to do the studies to find the answers she says grether says us researchers have begun taking prenatal blood samples from pregnant women and will look for clues when and if some of their children are diagnosed with autism they are examining hormones heavy metals immune system proteins and other factors the studies found no link with vaccines says dr irving gottesman a psychiatrist at the university of minnesota but says the us centers for disease control and prevention has initiated four studies to tie up the loose ends new studies are focusing on genetic susceptibilities link with vaccines gottesman says the studies may help to ease the fears of parents that a vaccineautism link has been covered up but he says scientists are battling a plethora of websites devoted to the idea that mercury causes autism like httpwwwsafemindsorg gernsbacher the mother of a child with autism says some parents may join these lobbying groups over the advice of doctors because they get pat answers to initial concerns about their children many may have been told that boys develop later than girls for instance the mistrust of governmentfunded studies and of their paediatricians may have arisen from those kind of experiences she says leaves with jagged edges like these maple leaves allow better uptake of nutrients at the start of the growing season when temperatures are cooler leaves with toothed edges help trees shrubs and other plants cope with the cold us researchers say and studying leaves from ancient and existing plants could help to reveal past and present climates they say in the current isssue of the international journal of plant sciences they say these climates are critical for determining periods of global warming and other profound temperature changes dr dana royer who authored the study with dr peter wilf at pennsylvania state university says that the jagged pointy edges on leaves are packed with xylem a tissue that transports water and nutrients in sap most of the liquid evaporates by leaving the teeth through minuscule pores in the springtime when leaves are just starting to leaf out leaves with teeth are on average losing more water than leaves without teeth says royer now an assistant professor of earth and environmental sciences at wesleyan university this loss of water helps pull more sap up from the roots thus trees with toothed leaves probably have a higher rate of sap flow early in the spring than toothless leaves this is important because it delivers nutrients to the developing leaves helping to jumpstart their photosynthetic season as you move to colder and colder climates with shorter and shorter growing seasons it becomes increasingly beneficial to have teeth he adds what transpires the researchers measured such moisture evaporation or transpiration and photosynthesis activity for leaves on woody species from two regions with differing climates pennsylvania and north carolina they determined that both energygathering activity and transpiration increased at jagged leaf edges by up to during the first days of the spring growing season leaves without teeth did not exhibit such a marked increase the scientists also found that plants native to colder climates like those in pennsylvanias south central york county had toothy edges that were especially active but possessing teeth may not always be advantageous for leaves since the teeth also promote more water loss plants in drier regions seem to be better off if they have fewer teeth or are toothless not everyone agrees another theory proposed by taylor field at taylor university holds that leaf teeth serve as a sort of release valve that prevents too much sap from collecting in the leaf professor judith totman parrish dean of the college of science at the university of idaho says she thinks the jury is still out on why plants have leaf teeth i think the authors have identified a very interesting problem and have made progress toward trying to answer it as to whether this is the ultimate answer that remains to be seen with further studies but the authors have kicked off a promising line of research parrish says royer says the research is important because we on earth today are experiencing rapid climate change a problem with trying to understand our current climate change is that it is an unreplicated experiment physicians in the middle ages inspected urine by holding it up to the light the colour of your urine can tell a lot about your health says a researcher whos concerned that modern medicine is overlooking this time honoured diagnostic tool the australian researcher says the ancient practice of examining patients urine could help doctors to monitor medication pinpoint disease and in some cases avoid costly and invasive tests dr carole foot an intensive care specialist at queenslands prince charles hospital publishes a paper on what she calls the uroscopic rainbow in the postgraduate medical journal the ancient greeks first diagnosed the rare blood disorder porphyria by observing colourful urine and even named the illness after the greek word for purple then in the middle ages when urine analysis enjoyed its heyday specimens were routinely examined in a matula or urine glass held up to the light foot says urine analysis could help today she says the idea for the paper hit her after being on a ward round and discovering a number of patients had discoloured urine here we were with these highly sophisticated monitoring devices that tell us all sorts of things about our critically ill patients and here we are doing something as old fashioned as looking at urine she says urine in the hospital foot says urine can provide information about whether patients are taking certain medications or are being overadministered for example propofol a common sedative in critical care wards turns urine pink if given in the right dose but green if patients are getting too much thats a signal for us to think about reducing the amount of propofol were giving she says and the antibiotic rifampicin used as an adjunct to other antibiotics and sometimes as a treatment for tuberculosis turns urine and other secretions including tears orange this means its being properly absorbed if you take a sample of urine and its orange you know the patients taking their tablets foot says it certainly can be used as an agent to monitor compliance using urine to diagnose disease dark brown or tea coloured urine can indicate infection in patients who have undergone heart or valve operations because it suggests the patient is haemolysing or breaking down red cells urine that turns black when exposed to air can also be a sign of alkaptonuria a rare enzyme disorder that causes abnormalities of the skin and cartilages and gout can produce pink urine foot says there are other ways of diagnosing these conditions today but whats interesting is that the way a lot of these conditions came to be diagnosed was based on people back in the middle ages noticing abnormalities in the urine using urine to rule out problems looking at urine can also help to rule out serious complications foot says a gp who sees a patient with red urine may jump to conclusions about something sinister this is because red urine points to bleeding and blood in the urine almost always means something abnormal but a simple question could make it clear that the urine is red because a patient is menstruating eating beetroot blackberry and rhubarb can also turn some peoples urine red while bluegreen urine can also be a sign a patient is drinking too much mouthwash ive seen people worked up about complex problems when they just didnt ask the patient something simple foot says what should your urine look like in a healthy person urine ranges in colour from almost clear to bright yellow because of a pigment known as urochrome but once the urochrome becomes concentrated urine can go dark yellow or brownish which suggests its time for a drink its a marker of hydration which can be used as a marker of whether youre drinking enough fluid particularly in summer foot says but urine inspection isnt always failproof she says because individual urine ph levels and genetic factors can influence whether or not certain substances discolour it circuit boards of the future could house smaller more powerful chips made with existing technology current chipmaking technology could make computer processors even tinier and cheaper than first thought researchers have discovered researchers at us technology firm ibm who released their findings at a silicon valley technology conference says the industry now has a reprieve from switching to more costly unproven chipmaking methods the commonlyused process of optical lithography has the potential to make chip circuitry more than a third as narrow as is standard in electronics today according to ibm this would mean a higherdensity memory or higher memory capacity in a small package the company says it will be up to chip producers to invest in developing the technology according to the company our goal is to push optical lithography as far as we can so the industry does not have to move to any expensive alternatives until absolutely necessary says robert allen a manager at ibms almaden research center in san jose this result is the strongest evidence to date that the industry may have at least seven years of breathing room before any radical changes in chipmaking techniques would be needed whats behind the push the discovery that computer components can be smaller cheaper and higher capacity than once thought came amid a worldwide technology push toward more versatile and compact handheld devices ibm scientists have created the tiniest highquality line patterns ever made using deepultraviolet optical lithography a technology currently used to print circuits on chips the distinct and uniformly spaced ridges are just under nanometres wide ibm says this is about onethird the size of the nanometre features now in mass production and below the nanometres that industry consensus held as the limit for optical lithography techniques according to the researchers whats moores law for decades the semiconductor industry has relied on continually shrinking circuits to drive increases in the performance and function of chips and the products that use them according to industry experts as chip features now approach the fundamental scale limits of individual atoms and molecules the future of this trend of relentless improvement referred to as moores law is in jeopardy ibm scientists say ibms new result indicates that a highindex immersion variant of lithography may provide a path for extending moores law buying the industry time cyclones will affect more people as coastal populations boom according to the latest scientific statement climate change cant be blamed for any of the events that made the past tropical cyclone season the worst in recent times a report by a group of international experts says no single high impact tropical cyclone event of and can be directly attributed to global warming it says in a report submitted to the world meteorological organizations wmo commission for atmospheric sciences which is meeting in south africa dr john mcbride is a principal research scientist at australias bureau of meteorology and reports to the wmo on the effects of climate change on tropical weather he is also chair of the international wmo committee that produced the report mcbride says the report came as an attempt to separate fact from fiction in relation to recent controversy about the role of climate change in producing tropical cyclones mcbride says theres no doubt that the latest season was the most ferocious in recent times with a series of vicious cyclones including hurricane katrina that devastated new orleans these last two years were probably the most severe since the satellite era began about years ago he says but he says evidence linking this to climate change is inconclusive or lacking the case against climate change a current argument suggests that as climate change causes the seas to warm the oceans store more energy that can be harnessed by the wind to form tropical cyclones but this is too simplistic mcbride says there are other conditions that are necessary to be able to tap that energy source such as the structure of the wind systems he says mcbride says theres no proof that cyclones have become more common or will become more frequent in the future or that theyll take place in more parts of the world worldwide theres really no evidence for any change he says he says the report also questions claims that tropical cyclones have become more intense over the past years saying data used in the past may be inaccurate or incomplete because of limitations with the technology of the day the rising damage toll mcbride says its true that the cost of cyclones in terms of life and property appears to be rising but he says this is because more people are living on the coast not because cyclones are becoming more severe theres a public perception that were getting disasters everywhere and part of this is due to the fact that there are so many people living in vulnerable areas he says given no change in tropical cyclone behaviour at all you will still get an increase in insurance damage and the financial scale of damage because of increasing coastal infrastructure sea levels what is of concern mcbride says is strong evidence that sea levels are rising in this way climate change may have an indirect effect on the potential for tropical cyclones to cause damage because of increasing storm surges from the sea this means that even if there is no change in tropical cyclones their potential to cause death and damage will increase if sea levels rise he says frogs produce a range of chemicals in their skins including ones that smell like cashew nuts now scientists say some of these chemicals repel insects some australian frogs create their own insect repellent some resembling rotten meat and others roasted cashew nuts or thyme leaves researchers find the research team which includes associate professor mike tyler of the university of adelaide and entomologist dr craig williams from james cook university publishes its findings online in the journal biology letters frogs produce a number of chemicals in their skin including hallucinogens glues and antimicrobials to ward off infection and stop other animals from trying to eat them we wanted to test professor tylers belief that they should also produce an insect repellent says williams the research team studied five species of australian frogs including the australian green tree frog using massage and acupuncture techniques they stimulated the muscles beneath the frogs skins to produce secretions what we found was that frogs produce a variety of chemicals in their skin and these ooze out of the pores of their skin when they are stressed says williams the secretions some of which repel mosquitos have different smells depending on a number of factors such as what the frog eats the frogs produce hundreds of chemicals and one frogs smell might be made up of six or seven different chemicals so they all smell quite different williams says the chemicals evaporate very quickly from the skin and its the volatile smell that repels the mosquitos a new mosquito repellent the team found that skin secretions from an australian green tree frog for example protected a mouse from mosquitos when the secretion was applied the researchers say this is the first time a vertebrate has been found to have its own inbuilt mosquito repellent but the frog secretion was not as repellent as deet diethylmtoluamide the ingredient in most commercial mosquito sprays williams doesnt believe that a new brand of natural insect repellent will result from the research the smell is just not very good some smell of rotting flesh some of nuts some of thyme leaves last year the frogsniffing research team won an ig nobel prize for its work on skin secretions the prizes honour achievements that first make people laugh and then make them think at the time the researchers talked about frog smells that reminded them of bombay curry and cut grass most of the worlds sharks live at depths that commercial trawlers can access a new study shows ocean depths beyond metres are almost devoid of sharks a finding that is grim news for these threatened fish a study finds an international team of researchers publishes its findings in the journal proceedings of the royal society b the researchers used deepsea trawls baited hooks and baited cameras to see where sharks live testing depths in the atlantic pacific and indian oceans and mediterranean sea from to metres they generally saw or caught sharks at up to metres but there were few sharks beyond this depth the deepest specimen was the leafscale gulper shark caught at metres this means that there are no reserves of sharks living in the abysses rarelyexplored depths that are beyond metres that comprise of the oceans volume as a result almost all sharks are within reach of modern deepsea trawlers which can net fish to a depth of up to metres sharks are apparently confined to about of the total ocean and distribution of many species is fragmented around sea mounts ocean ridges and ocean margins says the paper which mentions other chondrichthyes a category that also includes skates and rays all populations are therefore within reach of human fisheries and there is no hidden reserve of chondrichthyan biomass or biodiversity in the deep sea sharks may be more vulnerable to overexploitation than previously thought endangered or facing extinction of the species of shark are endangered or facing extinction according to the red list of threatened biodiversity compiled by the world conservation union iucn but this number is set to grow in the light of new data assessed by the iucns group of shark experts the swissbased agency says many shark species are very slowgrowing which means that a sudden drop in numbers can threaten their survival shark species have been ravaged by commercial trawling they are scooped up accidentally as bycatch by trawlers hunting more lucrative fish and are also being increasingly targeted for their fins which are used for the chinese sharkfin soup and for their liver which is rich in oil some species of chondrichthyan fish have adapted to the extreme pressures and poor light of the deep ocean the shark though seems to be excluded from life in the abysses because of a lack of food down there and the relatively high buoyancy of its liver says the paper by professor imants priede of scotlands university of aberdeen genes that govern aspects of social communication human bonding and spirituality help to determine whether youll make a good dancer research suggests professional dancers are born with at least two special genes that give them a leg up on the rest of us according to a new study recent research also has suggested that intelligence athletic ability and musical talent are linked to our genes and brain hardwiring with dancing added to the list the evidence indicates that certain individuals are born with a predisposition to specific behaviours and talents and that at least some of these qualities may represent evolved attributes i think that dancing is an evolved trait says professor richard ebstein who led the study published in a recent issue of the plos genetics journal animals have courtship dances and i think that human dancing represents the further development of a very ancient animal trait says ebstein a psychology professor at hebrew universitys scheinfeld center for genetic studies also the fact that dancing is universal and existed in all human societies even those communities of man separated geographically by tens of thousands of years aboriginal australians native americans africans eurasians attests to the very early origin of dance in our evolution as a species first find your dancers ebstein doctoral student rachel bachnermelman and their colleagues examined the dna of currently performing dancers and their parents they then did the same thing for competitive athletes and people who neither regularly dance nor often participate in sports the scientists discovered that dancers tend to possess variants of two genes that are involved in the transmission of information between nerve cells one of the identified genes is a transporter of serotonin a brain transmitter that contributes to spiritual experience the second is a receptor of the hormone vasopressin which many studies suggest modulates social communication and human bonding people are born to dance says ebstein they have other genes that partially contribute to musical talent such as coordination sense of rhythm however the genes we studied are more related to the emotional side of dancing the need and ability to communicate with other people and a spiritual side to their natures that not only enable them to feel the music but to communicate that feeling to others via dance ebstein believes some adults may possess the special gene variants but they perhaps never nurtured the related skills or recognised their hidden talent many of us surely have the ability but for a hundred reasons never exploited that particular talent he says ebstein explained that the identified genes seem to be linked to every form of dancing from tap to hula since all usually involve social communication and connecting to music or rhythms other factors to consider professor irving gottesman a senior fellow in psychology at the university of minnesota and an emeritus professor from the university of virginia is one of the worlds leading experts on genes as they relate to human behaviour and psychology gottesman emphasises previous research has shown that genes are only one part of complex causality systems that make us who we are for example he confirms that intelligence can be in our genes but that socioeconomic considerations such as a quality education can have a greater influence on a persons intellect ebstein agrees that genes are not the whole story he says those of us without a twinkletoed predisposition can still become good dancers since its not only a question of having the right genes but also training and motivation that make professional dancers scientists have been inspired by the path of a freefalling ball to work out a crucial step in quantum computing what can a quantum computer do the answer is as simple as watching a ball freefalling under gravity say australian physicists they say the maths that describes a falling ball can be used to identify algorithms for quantum computers to work on mark dowling and colleagues at the university of queensland report their argument in todays issue of the journal science some problems like finding the factors of very large numbers are beyond the capability of normal computers says dowling a simple example would be the factors are and he says but if i give you billion nine hundred and whatever and ask you what numbers multiply to give that thats a hard problem in general a standard computer will require n steps to find the factors of a number with n digits this means that as a number gets bigger the number of steps in the algorithm used to solve the problem increases exponentially and it becomes unfeasible to calculate but it is expected that quantum computers will be able to solve such problems more easily using algorithms that do not have an exponential increase in steps as the number increases quantum computers are only in their infancy right now which is why internet commerce can rely on encryption codes based on factoring very large numbers to secure credit card details but as quantum computers mature not only will this present a challenge for those involved in internet security researchers will also want to put these powerful computers to more useful work than cracking codes scientists have been looking for problems like factoring which would be suitable for a quantum computer to solve but so far its been a difficult task now the queensland researchers have found a surprising way of identifying quantum computer algorithms geometric inspiration dowling and colleagues were inspired by the field of mathematics called riemannian geometry which helps to find the shortest path between two points in a curved space picture a ball at the top of a hill in a hilly landscape about to travel from a to b the quickest path would be for the ball to fall freely from a under gravity working its way down the hill to b now imagine the hills are like steps in an algorithm the bigger the hill the more steps there may be many possible algorithms that solve a problem or paths to get from a to b but the ones with the least number of steps are equivalent to the path taken by the freefalling ball the researchers have found that the maths that describes the path of the freefalling ball can be used to identify algorithms suitable for quantum computer problems its a new route to finding problems that a quantum computer can do easily says dowling he says there are many problems that standard computers cannot solve and that may be candidates for quantum computing one such problem is the travelling salesman problem which identifies the shortest route for someone visiting a large number of locations pluto is in the centre and charon is just below it the new moons p and p are to the right of pluto and charon the tiny distant and frozen planet pluto for years believed to have just one moon has two more satellites us astronomers confirm they tentatively announced the discovery of the two moons last november now theyve confirmed their find after spending six months analysing images from the hubble space telescope and publishing their work in todays issue of the journal nature plutos first known satellite charon was not discovered until with a diameter of kilometres it is half that of pluto abnormally large for a moon in relation to its planet some scientists suspected pluto had other tiny moons but at such a great distance from earth they have been hard to spot the two additional orbiting satellites p and p are travelling outside the orbit of charon and are tiny by comparison say scientists led by dr hal weaver of johns hopkins university p the more distant of the two from pluto has a diameter of between and kilometres while p is smaller although definitive orbits cannot be derived both new satellites appear to be moving in circular orbits in the same orbital plane as charon with orbital periods of about days for p and days for p they write charons density is also very similar to that of plutos which appears to back theories that the planet whacked into a large space object causing a large chunk to break off and eventually be enslaved as a satellite p and p may have resulted from the same collision says dr alan stern of the southwest research institute in the same issue of nature first with multiple satellites the discovery of the two new members of plutos family make it the only object in the kuiper belt a vast region of rock and ice beyond neptune that contains debris from the formation of the solar system known to have multiple satellites the scientists say the scientists also expect plutos small moons to generate debris rings of their own from surface impacts this would open up a whole new class of study because it would constitute the first ring system seen around a solid body rather than a gas giant planet says sterns colleague and coauthor dr bill merline pluto was only discovered in and because of its vast distance from earth has remained largely enigmatic ever since its some three billion miles from the sun and the only planet not yet to have been visited by a spacecraft nasas new horizons mission which was launched earlier this year will be the first to take a detailed look at pluto in and the kuiper belt by japanese people traditionally eat eel on the hottest days of summer to combat the heat seen here restaurant owners inspecting their stock ahead of national eel day an ancient mystery surrounding the japanese eel a species as prized by fishermen for its high price as it is by chefs for its delicate flesh has been explained at last like its atlantic cousins the japanese eel anguilla japonica matures in freshwater but then migrates out to sea to spawn but where this act is carried out has until now been an enigma the answer says a japanese ocean researcher today in the journal nature lies in a tiny triangle of the pacific ocean about kilometres east of the philippines near underwater mountains west of the mariana islands there male and female eels gather in the waning moonlight in the middle of the year luxuriating in the balmy tropical waters university of tokyo scientist professor katsumi tsukamoto collected newlyhatched eels during a research trip aboard an oceanographic vessel the hakuho maru last year the creatures were still in a microscopic larval state and could only be identified with a dna test the scientist pinpointed their spawning site as deg north deg east to the west of the suruga seamount in the southern part of the west mariana ridge the eels had hatched about four days before the new moon of june just the spot the site is cleverly chosen because it enables the hatchlings to be carried northwestward on the kuroshio current which flows towards the coastline of china and japan where the eels mature in rivers and lakes if the spawning were to occur only a little bit further south the infant eels could get swept up in the mindanao current which runs southwards down the eastern side of the philippine archipelago the love grounds of the japanese eel are tiny when compared to those of its two atlantic relatives the european and american eels a anguilla and a rostrata which reproduce in the sargasso sea in the eastern caribbean grilled steamed grilled or baked the eel is a delicacy in japan where it is known as unagi most eels sold for food come from aquaculture but these eels come from wild eels that are caught and put in fish farms to mature in captivity a surge in demand as a result of surging demand and disruption to its reproductive cycle catches of this species have fallen by threequarters in the past years according to the un food and agriculture organization the price of japanese eel has soared over the past decade prompting importers to turn to cheaper european eels to meet demand in turn this has encouraged dangerously unsustainable catches of european elvers known as glass eels because they are transparent for the first few years of their life racalibration of the earths radiocarbon clock is changing what we know about when early humans colonised europe the ancestors of modern humans moved into and across europe ousting the neanderthals faster than once thought a new analysis of radiocarbon data shows rather than taking some years to colonise europe from africa the reinterpreted data shows the process may only have taken years professor paul mellars from the university of cambridge publishes his results today in the journal nature the same chronological pattern points to a substantially shorter period of chronological and demographic overlap between the earliest modern humans and the last survivors of the preceding neanderthal populations the professor of prehistory and human evolution writes the reassessment is based on advances in eliminating modern carbon contamination from ancient bone fragments and recalibration of fluctuations in the pattern of the earths original carbon content university researchers have for example found better ways of preparing bone collagen for analysis this involves a process of ultrafiltration which removes contaminants with a lower molecular weight such as organic salts and humic acids and taking into account the carbon signature of deepsea sediments and ice cores has allowed researchers to recalibrate radiocarbon ages taking over the world populations of anatomically and behaviourally modern humans first appeared in the middle east some years ago and slowly expanded into southeastern europe previously it was thought that this spread took place between and years ago but the reevaluated data suggests that it actually happened between and years ago starting earlier and moving faster evidently the native neanderthal populations of europe succumbed much more rapidly to competition from the expanding biologically and behaviourally modern populations than previous estimates have generally assumed mellars writes he says the invasion could have been helped by a major change in the climate that modern man would have been technologically and culturally better equipped to deal with than the more primitive neanderthals there are increasing indications that over many areas of europe the final demise of the neanderthal populations may have coincided with the sudden onset of very much colder and drier climatic conditions mellars writes this could have delivered the coup de grace to the neanderthals in many parts of western and central europe in their economic and demographic competition with the incoming modern groups he adds scientists have pinned down the genes responsible for the type of starch found in wheat researchers are making highfibre wheat using gene silencing technology but hope to use oldfashioned plant breeding methods to bring it to market they have used a genetic modification gm method known as rna interference or rnai to identify the genes responsible for high fibre but rather than marketing such a gm wheat they plan to select for plants with the right genetic make up and breed them the conventional way scientists from australias csiro and the frenchbased agricultural biotechnology company biogemma uk report their findings today in the proceedings of the national academy of science rnai is a way of changing the expression of particular genes in plants says author dr matthew morell a geneticist from csiros food futures national research flagship the technology involves inserting a fragment of dna into the wheat a fragment similar to one of the plants own dna sequences this triggers the plants defence system to search out and destroy the resulting rna used to make a particular enzyme usually this enzyme would convert the starch molecule amylose to amylopectin but if the gene that produces that enzyme is silenced the wheat is higher in amylose wheat higher in amylose is harder to digest which makes it healthier the scientists say it lowers the rate of blood sugar uptake and increases the passage of fibre into the large bowel potentially reducing the risk of developing obesity diabetes and bowel disease there are a number of enzymes that convert amylose to amylopectin and one of the important parts of the research was to identify the critical enzyme that needed to be silenced to give wheat with highamylose starch the scientists did this by silencing a number of different enzymes in wheat then testing the resultant starch rat tests the team then fed the gm wheat to rats and compared its impact to that of standard wholemeal wheat they report that the rats fed the gm wheat had more bowel contents and a lower bowel ph indicating better gastrointestinal health the rats faeces also had increased levels of shortchain fatty acids which have been associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer the researchers say and says morell the high amylose content of the wheat means it is potentially another tool for managing our diets glycaemic index or gi the oldfashioned way the team is not developing highamylose gm wheat rather it is using the information gained in this experiment to develop an equivalent nongm variety people particularly in our major export markets are still not accepting gm technology says morell so the major international wheat producers countries like australia the us and canada are not willing to risk those markets at the moment by having gm crops the research so far has told the team the genes that are important in creating a highamylose wheat this will give them a shortcut to breeding a new variety using conventional breeding methods a technological shortcut he says the new breeding program is already well under way but the details of when the new variety will be ready are commercialinconfidence the technological shortcut which cost several million dollars to research will save decades in developing a highamylose wheat variety says morell without rnai which csiro developed about five years ago scientists would have had to find and combine nine different very rare mutant wheat varieties he says ecstasy use has risen between and says the un ecstasy the drug that some doctors blame for depression and anxiety may often only enhance these symptoms rather than cause them according to a study published today dutch researchers found that children who suffered from depression were more likely to go on to use the illegal drug when they grew up to make them feel better the appearance later in life of mental health problems in these people might not therefore be primarily due to their use of ecstasy but could reflect preexisting conditions using ecstasy may increase a risk that is already there says anja huizink assistant professor at the erasmus medical center in rotterdam author of the study that appears in the british medical journal today other studies claim that ecstasy leads to depression huizink says sometimes that is the case but perhaps it is more the case that individuals who already have an increased risk for depression are more likely to use ecstasy clubbers ecstasy methylenedioxymethamphetamine or mdma was used in the s to treat depression it helps the body to relax reduces inhibitions increases energy and brings feelings of euphoria the drug is now used by millions of young people around the world especially clubbers who say it can help them dance all night united nations data suggests the use of ecstasy surged by between and but ecstasy has increasingly been linked with health problems such as depression especially where individuals have used the drug heavily over a long time the dutch study of individuals over years left open the possibility that ecstasy might cause depression in some cases perhaps for individuals who did not display symptoms of depression and anxiety in childhood using a lot of ecstasy may also cause depression we are not saying that is not the case but we need more studies says huizink more than a decade later she and her colleagues first looked at their sample in before ecstasy appeared as a recreational drug in the netherlands use of the drug was then assessed years later individuals with signs of anxiety and depression in showed an increased risk of starting to use ecstasy the researchers say other factors not tested in their study could account for some people to be more likely to use ecstasy these included the social environment novelty seeking and the substance use of parents focusing on these vulnerable individuals in future studies will increase our insight into the potential harmful effects of mdma they conclude for more information about ecstasy and other drugs

cosmic explosion has been spotted in earths celestial neighbourhood scientists report the blast seems like a gammaray burst one of the most distant and powerful type of explosion known to astronomers but when scientists first detected it with nasas swift satellite on february the explosion was about times closer and lasted times longer than a typical gammaray burst this is totally new totally unexpected says dr neil gehrels swifts principal investigator this is the type of unscripted event in our nearby universe that we hoped swift could catch the explosion originated in a starforming galaxy about million lightyears away towards the constellation aries a lightyear is about trillion kilometres the distance light travels in a year this would be the secondclosest gammaray burst ever detected if indeed it is one the burst lasted for nearly seconds or about minutes astronomers say most bursts last a few milliseconds to tens of seconds the burst was also surprisingly dim scientists at italys national institute for astrophysics found hints of a budding supernova an exploding star when they saw the afterglow from the original explosion grow brighter in optical light if it is a

come from cigarette butts are among many chemicals vacuumed up in dust from sydneys roads chemicals from car exhausts asphalt and cigarette butts are covering our roads an australian study suggests and accumulated runoff may need to be treated as toxic waste says researcher associate professor james ball of the university of technology sydney as well as raising environmental concerns this finding may mean authorities will face increased cleanup costs ball says the researchers went out onto sydney roads with a modified vacuum cleaner to suck up samples the first study to look at polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and nicotine in road dust they found dirt blown in from many kilometres and when the researchers analysed particles smaller than micrometres in size they identified chemicals including nicotine plasticisers and pahs nobodys gone looking for these before says ball who has been studying pollution on road surfaces for the past years roads make up about onefifth of the urban land area he says and about half the impervious surfaces he says any pollutants that fall on roads can easily wash off into the stormwater system with the slightest rain even small storms yielding millimetres of rainfall can mobilise the dust says ball the dust then enters the waterways silting up creeks ponds and wetlands in the dust nicotine most likely from tossed away cigarette butts is an alkaloid with a halflife in the environment of days and can be toxic to aquatic organisms pahs come from a range of sources including vehicle exhausts asphalt roads and fires pahs can accummulate in living tissue and some are carcinogens says professor des connell of griffith university in brisbane pahs will be taken up by fish and accumulate in fish he says ball also found many other previously reported pollutants in the dust like phosphorous that leads to algal blooms and he found trace amounts of heavy metals such as lead and zinc from tyres petrol and bearings chromium from wear and tear on car bodies and copper from brake linings all of these are potentially hazardous he says cleaning up ball says the discovery of new pollutants on roads like pahs has implications for authorities which already have their hands full treating stormwater pollution it expands the number of contaminants that we have to manage he says and he says authorities may have to pay more attention to runoff from roads currently says ball authorities are focused on the immediate risk to humans from sewage contaminating stormwater systems and the immediate risk to waterways from nutrients but he says the discovery of environmentally persistent chemicals in road runoff may mean areas receiving the runoff may eventually have to be treated like toxic waste ball says he received funding from the new south wales environment protection authority now the department of environment and conservation and the roads and traffic authority for his study which is yet to be published this beaverlike mammal castorocauda lutrasimilis would have taken a dip about million years ago mammals took to water million years earlier than anyone thought say scientists after the discovery of a curious beaverlike fossil in china the animal lived million years ago alongside dinosaurs report us and chinese researchers in the latest issue of the journal science it had a flat paddlelike tail and webbed feet resembling a beaver and it had fur and even the inner ear structure of a mammal the scientists say but it might have not gnawed trees as modern beavers do its teeth suggest it ate fish professor thomas martin of the forschungsinstitut senckenberg in frankfurt germany says the finding shows the diversity of early mammals this exciting fossil is a further jigsawpuzzle piece in a series of recent discoveries demonstrating that the diversity and early evolutionary history of mammals were much more complex than perceived less than a decade ago he writes in a commentary the fossil was found in the middle jurassic jiulongshan formation in china a deposit rich in the fossils of dinosaurs early insects and other creatures that dates to million years ago dr qiang ji and colleagues at nanjing university in china and the carnegie museum of natural history in pittsburgh say the animal which they named castorocauda lutrasimilis would have weighed just grams it is the most primitive taxon in the mammalian lineage known to have fur and has a broad flattened partly scaly tail analogous to that of modern beavers they write they found remnants of fur scales on the tail and in between the back toes webbing an acidic burp can give you heartburn symptoms reflux doesnt have to be extremely acidic to give you that burning feeling a new study shows in fact burping can result in heartburn even when no liquid accompanies the gas up the oesophagus dutch researchers report dr aj bredenoord and colleagues from st antonius hospital in nieuwegein the netherlands report their findings in the latest issue of the journal gut the researchers monitored patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease or gerd who had stopped taking their acidsuppressing medication they were monitored for hours using traditional ph testing as well as a technique called impedance impedance allows researchers to evaluate how far reflux extends up from the stomach measure the volume of reflux and evaluate acidity with greater precision its a completely new way of looking at reflux bredenoord says the acid test there were episodes of reflux of them causing symptoms episodes that caused symptoms showed a larger increase in acidity within the oesophagus more acidity and extended further up the oesophagus the volume of reflux in heartburncausing episodes was larger than for those that caused no symptoms while the liquid also took longer to clear from the oesophagus nearly of reflux episodes were caused by more weakly acidic reflux material just gas the researchers also identified gasonly reflux episodes of which caused symptoms symptoms were more likely with gas reflux if they were accompanied by a rise in acidity the findings show that if you only focus on looking at whether these symptoms are related to acid you will certainly miss a few patients who symptoms are also related to weakly acid reflux bredenoord says and volume of reflux as well as its acidity plays a role in whether it causes symptoms he adds new drugs he points out that some drug companies are developing medications designed to reduce the number of reflux episodes rather than targeting acidity as all currently available gerd drugs do this could be helpful for the minority of patients whose symptoms are due to more weakly acid reflux he says for more information on heartburn and reflux see the consumer information section of the gastroenterological society of australia website a watchdog would monitor research to make sure it wasnt used by bioterrorists yet would allow legitimate research to continue but not everyone agrees this balance is possible a global watchdog is needed to prevent science being misused to produce biological weapons say canadian academics bioterrorists require darkness to succeed says professor peter singer director of the joint centre for bioethics at the university of toronto which has published a report calling for global network of experts to help spot any misuses of science for biological warfare in effect were calling for an iaea of biotechnology he adds referring to the international atomic energy authority the global nuclear watchdog not with a team of iaeatype inspectors though but an expanding global network of scientists the rationale behind the report entitled dna for peace reconciling biodevelopment and biosecurity is fear that there will be a crackdown on genuine scientific research in the name of biosecurity an attempt to prevent biological warfare or deliberately created epidemics the question is how do you create a system where people are talking in such a way that you can enhance the positive use of biotechnology and protect against the misuse of them in such areas as bioterrorism says elizabeth dowdeswell coauthor of the report and the former head of the un environment program the scientists want the group of eight industrialised nations to help create the new watchdog and they want investment in positive applications of biological sciences in developing countries that would include efforts to cure or prevent disease and to alleviate poverty they say but dr eikehenner kluge an expert on bioethics and a professor at the university of victoria in british columbia says a surveillance network is pragmatically unrealistic he questioned who would monitor and pay for the proposed body how do you balance a possible negative threat on the one hand with a possible good on the other says kluge this is the twoedged sword that accompanies any research marmoset fathers gain weight while their partners are pregnant to prepare for their role as a new dad fathers of at least two primate species gradually gain weight during their mates pregnancy a new study has found researchers observed this classic female pregnancy symptom in common marmoset callithrix jacchus and cottontop tamarin saguinus oedipus male primates they published their results in a recent issue of the journal biology letters the scientists suspect that males in most monogamous primates including gibbons some lemurs species and humans also show signs of pregnancy when their mates are expecting while the new study represents the first evidence for gradual weight gain in nonhuman primate expectant fathers earlier research found that of all human fathers have experienced some symptoms of pregnancy the symptoms include weight gain nausea headaches irritability restlessness backaches colds nervousness and hormonal changes such as higher levels of the stressfighting hormone cortisol and the strengthboosting hormone testosterone previously it was thought that these were just psychosomatic symptoms but for many such dads it is likely that the changes help them to cope with the rigours of fatherhood once the baby is born this is particularly important for the doting yet squirrelsized marmoset and tamarin dads whose job includes toting around their often hefty babies males do most of the carrying of infants usually two once they are born says dr toni ziegler lead author of the study the males invest highly in infant care even losing weight while carrying these heavy multiple infants through the trees says ziegler a senior scientist at the university of wisconsin madison ziegler and her team obtained monthly weight measurements for male marmosets and male cottontop tamarins of these monkeys nine marmosets and tamarins had pregnant mates the researchers determined that the expectant fathers experienced roughly a increase in weight gain during their mates pregnancy the extra weight which was not associated with copied eating habits occurred gradually over the gestation periods which are five months for marmosets and about six months for tamarins the extra padding is not the only pregnancy symptom that scientists have identified in the monkey dads the males apparently are so in tune with their mates that they undergo other physiological changes we have found for cottontop tamarins that males show hormonal changes around midpregnancy and these changes may help prepare them for their role in infant care ziegler says they also detect when their mate is going to ovulate and have an increase in testosterone a few days before she ovulates so i think they are getting signals for the female at important reproductive events hardly surprising brian craft lead keeper at oakland zoo in california is not surprised by the findings craft says most monogamous nonhuman primate dads have the following daily schedule feed travel rest and then more of the same with just a little time in between for play the weight gain could serve as a decoy for predation but it more likely fortifies males who have less time for foraging once the offspring are born the changes therefore may benefit the entire family he adds the length of a particular gene controls your risk of developing depression after divorce unemployment or illness more than a fifth of the population has a genetic predisposition to major depression triggered by a string of stressful life events australian researchers announce these events include the loss of a parent or other significant relative a relationship breakdown or employment financial housing and health crises the study published in the latest issue of the british journal of psychiatry found a gene that controls the neurotransmitter serotonin is crucial the researchers found that people with a short version of the serotonin transporter gene have an chance of developing clinical depression if they have three or more negative life events in a year people with a long or more protective version of the gene only have a risk of becoming depressed under similar circumstances the study by researchers from the university of new south wales with affiliated research institutes and teaching hospitals evaluated the relationship between genes and life experience from young adulthood into middle age in teachers across years it is the first study to account for the timing of the first onset of depression across the lifespan the long and the short of it short and long versions of the serotonin transporter gene httlpr located on chromosome are created by a slight variation in the sequence of dna one version of the gene is inherited from each parent in certain combinations according to the research those who inherit two short versions are the most susceptible to depression the study showed of us have two short versions of the gene two long versions and the rest have one long and one short variant professor philip mitchell head of the universitys school of psychiatry and convenor of brain sciences unsw emphasises that this is a susceptibility or risk gene not a disease gene having two short versions of the gene doesnt make you depressed per se it increases the likelihood of becoming depressed if you experience stressful life events he says identifying whos at risk mitchell says the findings could help identify people at increased risk of depression and help direct resources into preventative interventions for people with the susceptible genetic make up i think this will spark off important clinical debate about when tests like this should become clinically available he says the ethical question is not only whether this test should be made available publicly but also who should have access to the results we err on the side of privacy but private insurance bodies for example could demand the information as part of their risk assessment for information about depression

in volcanic debris scientists are unearthing the pompeii of the east an indonesian village buried nearly two centuries ago by the largest volcanic eruption in recorded history two years ago a team of scientists including those from the university of rhode island and the indonesian directorate of volcanology and geological hazard mitigation began digging up the village of tambora which was buried by a volcanic eruption in the excavation shows how tamboras residents were killed in moments by an avalanche of hot volcanic ash rock and volcanic gas known as a pyroclastic flow the village was buried in metres of volcanic debris and in all people were killed the eruption was the largest in recorded history says haraldur sigurdsson a university of rhode island professor who has studied tambora since events of this type will occur in the future and we should be aware of what could happen he says the eruption of mount tambora on sumbawa island blew times more magma and pulverised rock into the air than mount st helens in the us state of washington in according to sigurdsson tamboras blast also sent sulfur dioxide kilometres into the air creating a chemical chain reaction in the atmosphere that caused a year of global cooling that made the year without a summer scientists located tambora with help from a local guide who told them that pottery fragments and human bones had been found in a gully in the mid dig scientists discovered an entombed house with two people inside one woman was found in the kitchen her hand next to glass bottles that had been melted by the ash flow the house on wooden stilts with bamboo siding and a thatched roof had been incinerated into charcoal by the fiery ash that sigurdsson believes was at least degc the finding is significant sigurdsson says because it means that we know that in an eruption such as that in that pyroclastic flows extend from the volcano in all directions to a distance of at least kilometres radially and within that zone there is an extinction of all life scientists also studied the deposits of volcanic ash and documented the size of the particles and their distance from the volcano says steven carey a university of rhode island professor with a background in physical volcanology the data can be plugged into computer models that will simulate volcano blasts and their potential fallout he adds the deposits are one factor used to determine tamboras eruption rate or how much content was spewed out of the volcano and how quickly that says sigurdsson will determine when relatively harmless fallout

regions the image is of the gigantic pinwheel galaxy or messier and was compiled from images from the hubble space telescope with extra data from groundbased telescopes the image reveals a giant spiral disc of stars dust and gas some lightyears across about twice the diameter of the milky way a highresolution version of the image which shows individual stars is available on the space telescope science institute website the galaxy contains about one trillion stars about billion thought to be about the same age and temperature as our sun its spiral arms have large starforming nubulae star nurseries in hydrogen clouds and bright young clusters of newborn blue stars trace out the spiral arms the disc of the galaxy is so thin the researchers say that hubble easily sees many more distant galaxies through it the pinwheel galaxy lies in the northern constellation the great bear and is about million lightyears from earth the light we see from the galaxy today is as it was at

fatigue syndrome cfs might be caused by a temporary brain injury during the early inflammatory stages of glandular fever according to australian scientists we believe that parts of the brain which control perception of fatigue and pain are damaged during the acute infection phase of glandular fever says lead researcher professor andrew lloyd from the university of new south wales the researchers who publish their study this week in the journal of infectious diseases believe the epsteinbarr virus which causes glandular fever might trigger cfs in some people while most people with glandular fever recover in several weeks disabling symptoms including prolonged fatigue can last for at least six months known as cfs the scientists found the virus itself does not cause this ongoing fatigue but they hypothesise that a hit and run brain injury does if youre still sick several weeks after infection it seems the symptoms arent being driven by the activity of the virus in the body its happening in the brain lloyd says the study is the first to follow patients within a few weeks of acute glandular fever infection for a year it tracked people including eight who were sick for at least six months and who recovered quickly levels of virus in the blood were no different in patients who recovered quickly from those whose fatigue lasted more than six months its not the virus or an ongoing inflammatory response directed at the virus causing ongoing symptoms but an inflammatory process in the acute illness might disturb brain function and make it stay symptomatic lloyd says the mystery of cfs lloyd says cfs affects one in australians and millions worldwide it is a group of symptoms for which there is no medical or psychiatric explanation including unrefreshing sleep muscle and joint pain concentration and memory difficulties and prolonged fatigue people with cfs are often unable to work or attend school theories about causes range from muscle and immune system to psychiatric problems hormonal changes and the growing body of data linking infectious diseases including glandular fever as a trigger the scientists will test their hypothesis by doing brain scans on study participants for more information on cfs see the mechronic fatigue syndrome association of australias website australias new chief scientist is a longterm advocate of gm crops the position has been vacant for nine months but australia now has a new chief scientist whose appointment has been met with a spectrum of responses from unqualified support to downright disappointment dr jim peacock the year old former chief of csiro plant industry and head of the australian academy of science was yesterday appointed as the prime ministers new parttime adviser on science and technology peacock is still finalising his contract under which he will continue his role as a senior researcher at csiro he takes up the reins from the previous chief scientist dr robin batterham who resigned amidst claims that his advice to government was influenced by the interests of resource and energy giant rio tinto a company he worked for part time peacock says he does not anticipate his dual role will result in any conflicts of interest but some commentators say his impartiality may be questioned nevertheless gm advocate one issue is his ongoing support for genetic modification gm technology it think the integration of these gm technologies into our agribusiness will be essential for the future peacock told abc radio today he acknowledges there are many concerns in the community about gm food and crops but hopes this will change as people understand the benefits of the technology professor ian lowe head of the australian conservation foundation and emeritus professor at griffith university says it is appropriate that a distinguished scientist has taken up the role of chief scientist but foresees problems hes been a longstanding advocate of genetic technology so hes not going to be seen as neutral in the discussions about that issue says lowe while labor welcomes the appointment the greens say they are extremely disappointed and see peacocks advocacy of gm as highly divisive in their lifetime western women will have four times as many periods as women from some traditional societies regularly skipping menstrual periods using methods including the contraceptive pill might help reduce the risk of some gynaecological cancers a conference will hear next week professor ian fraser a professor of reproductive medicine at australias university of sydney says the fewer periods a woman has the better the modern consequences of too much menstruation include breast ovarian and endometrial cancers endometriosis uterine fibroids polycystic ovary syndrome and severe cyclical menstrual symptoms he will tell the human reproductive health through the ages conference in adelaide the belief is regular menses means a good clean out but having lots of periods is not a healthy process fraser says in our society women have many more periods than in primitive societies and each menstrual cycle leads to big swings in the ovarian hormones oestrogen and progesterone fraser says this overstimulates reproductive organs and the breasts the uterus lining of the uterus and breasts were not designed to cope with this and it causes some cells to grow and regress each month which means a greater chance of error in the proliferation process of abnormal cells he says breast cancer in our society is fold greater than in primitive societies and having lots of menstrual cycles probably plays a role in that he says substantial increases in the risk of endometrial cancer occurs as the uterus lining grows and regresses each month and in ovarian cancer as ovaries grow and regress during egg release my view is we probably have sufficient strong supportive anecdotal and suggestive evidence although no solid longterm evidence that for many women taking the pill or an intrauterine device for extra years than they might have done for contraception may help later protect against a number of conditions fraser says present day kalahari bushwomen have about periods in a lifetime compared with western womens in our society girls menstruate earlier and women have more periods before giving birth than women like the kalahari women from traditional societies breastfeed for extended times often conceive soon after menses return average five to six pregnancies and have an earlier menopause all factors that reduce the number of periods they have in a lifetime brain

funded by the pentagon defense advanced research projects agency darpa scientists involved in the scheme presented their work last week at a meeting on ocean sciences in honolulu hawaii the report says a team at boston university has implanted electrodes into the brain of a spiny dogfish in a shallow tank the implants controlled by a small radio transmitter stimulate either the right or left side of a brain area dedicated to smell causing the fish to flick around in that direction in response to the signal the next step will be to take this device outside the laboratory blue sharks implanted with the gadget are to be released off the coast of florida as radio signals will not penetrate the sea communications with the fish will be made through us navy acoustic towers capable of sending sonar signals to a shark up to kilometres away other darpafunded researchers are working on using implants to record brain activity in sharks to understand which neurons are fired by scents electrical or magnetic fields these signals help the fish to navigate and offer the reward of food and could thus in theory be manipulated for surveillance work new scientist says the darpa work is controversial but also points out that work with animal implants also has a potential benefit for medicine understanding more about the brains electrical signals could one day result in implants to control a prosthetic limb to overcome paralysis the report says experts disagree about which of shakespeares portraits are real or fake and what we can tell about his health by studying them william shakespeare died in pain of a rare form of cancer that deformed his left eye according to a german academic who says she has discovered the disease in four genuine portraits of the worlds most famous playwright as londons national portrait gallery prepares to reveal in a show that only one out of six portraits of the bard may be his exact likeness professor hildegard hammerschmidthummel from the university of mainz provides forensic evidence of at least four contemporary portraits of shakespeare hammerschmidthummel who will publish in april the results of her year research in the book the true face of william shakespeare used forensic imaging technologies to examine nine images believed to portray the playwright these technologies included the trick image differentiation technique photogrammetry computer montages and laser scanning four of these portraits shared identical features the chandos and flower portrait the davenant bust and the darmstadt death mask all showed one and the same man william shakespeare they depict his features in such precise detail and so true to life that they could only have been produced by an artist for whom the poet sat personally says hammerschmidthummel the portraits show a growth on the upper left eyelid and a protuberance in the nasal corner which seems to represent three different stages of a disease at shakespeares time the artists depicted their sitters realistically and accurately absolutely true to life including all visible signs of disease hammerschmidthummel says a team of doctors analysed the paintings and concluded that shakespeare who died aged in most likely suffered from a rare form of cancer according to ophthalmologist dr walter lerche the playwright suffered from a cancer of the tear duct known as mikuliczs syndrome a protuberance in the nasal corner of the left eye was interpreted as a small caruncular tumour dermatologist dr jost metz diagnosed a chronic annular skin sarcoidosis while the yellowish spots on the lower lip of the flower portrait were interpreted as an inflammation of the oral mucous membrane indicating a debilitating systemic illness shakespeare must have been in quite considerable pain the deformation of the left eye was no doubt particularly distressing it can also be assumed that the trilobate protuberance in the nasal corner of the left eye causing a marked deviation of the eyelid margin was experienced as a large and painful obstruction hammerschmidthummel says her findings have stirred a controversy in england the national portrait gallery which conducted a fouryear study of possible surviving portraits for the exhibition searching for shakespeare stresses that today we have no certain lifetime portrait of englands most famous poet and playwright hammerschmidthummels conclusion is based on a fundamental misunderstanding since portraits are not and can never be forensic evidence of likeness the gallery says most experts including those at the national portrait gallery agree that only the chandos painting may be a likely shakespeare portrait the terracotta davenant bust which has been standing for years in the london gentlemans garrick club has long believed to be work of the th century french sculptor roubiliac hammerschmidthummel traced it back to the times of shakespeare through the diary of william clift curator of the royal college of surgeons hunterian museum in london she learned that clift found the bust in near a theatre that was previously owned by sir william davenant shakespeares godson davenant owned many shakespeare mementos including the chandos painting its a fake the most controversial seems to be the flower portrait which the national portrait gallery dismissed as a fake as it featured a pigment not in use until around hammerschmidthummel contends that the painting is nothing more than a copy of the portrait she examined years ago the original flowers had evidence of swelling around the eye and forehead while the one about to go on display at the gallery does not have these features she says the darmstadt death mask socalled because it resides in darmstadt castle in germany has been long dismissed as a th century fake but according to hammerschmidthummel the features and most of all the impression of a swelling above the lefteye make it certain that it was taken shortly after shakespeares death a d technique of photogrammetry made visible craters of the swelling this was really stunning evidence hammerschmidthummel says bounty bay on pitcairn island shows the islands typical steep rocky shoreline the original polynesian community on the pitcairn islands died out because it lost touch with its neighbours who provided crucial resources an australian archaeologist says dr marshall weisler of the university of queensland will discuss his research on the reliance of pitcairn islanders on the neighbouring mangareva or gambier islanders at a conference in mexico later this year pitcairn is the kind of island that can only have people on it in the long run if its being resourced from outside periodically says weisler who has been studying pitcairn since it wasnt sustainable in the long run because the trading connections between the pitcairn group and mangareva stopped the ukgoverned pitcairn islands are a group of four small rugged and relatively barren islands in a remote part of the western pacific today they are home to a handful of descendants of fletcher christian who led the mutiny on the bounty in the two main islands in the group are pitcairn and henderson which were originally settled in around to ad he says by a couple of dozen polynesians from the neighbouring island of mangareva but by the time the spanish explorer ferdinand queros sailed by in the islands had been abandoned surviving on pitcairn weisler spent several months at pitcairn to work out why he says archaeological evidence collected suggests early pitcairn inhabitants ate seafood and seabirds such as the booby and used earth ovens to cook he says they put a fair bit of pressure on the islands resources for example some species of land birds went extinct

if it were to hit earth it would deliver megatonnes of energy equivalent to all the worlds nuclear weapons vd was spotted in late november and was swiftly identified as a rock that potentially crosses earths orbit at the time watchers gave it one in risk of collision on may further observations and calculations have prompted the risk on that day to be upgraded to a bit less than in says nasa nearearth object neo expert dr david morrison the risk of an impact within the next century is higher than that of any other known asteroid he says stressing however that the likelihood of a hit is small fortunately it is nearly a century before the close pass from vd this should provide ample time to refine the orbit and most probably determine that the asteroid will miss the earth vd was previously categorised as a grade green which means merits careful watching on the torino scale of neo hazards but it has been upgraded to grade yellow meaning meriting attention there are two more grades beyond this orange or close encounter and red or collision is certain involving objects capable of inflicting regional or global devastation the asteroids closest proximity to earth on the flyby was not given by morrison or the hazard list maintained by nasa and the us jet propulsion laboratory biggest threat vds place at the top of the list was briefly snatched in december by a rock called apophis further observations however downgraded apophis risk to a one in chance of collision making it a grade green risk apophis measuring metres across and with a mass of less than million tonnes will fly by at a distance of kilometres from the earths surface on april this is slightly higher than the altitude of geosynchronous satellites according to the website of the international astronomical unions minor planet center a floating iceberg off the antarctic peninsula antarcticas mammoth ice sheet is in significant decline scientists say probably due to climate change us researchers at the university of colorado at boulder say online in the journal science today the antarctic ice sheet is losing up to cubic kilometres of ice a year this is the first study to indicate the total mass balance of the antarctic ice sheet is in significant decline says dr isabella velicogna of the universitys cooperative institute for research in environmental sciences the team calculated that the ice sheet lost cubic kilometres a year from april to august give or take cubic kilometres this is equivalent to global seas rising millimetres a year with a margin of error of millimetres the researchers say the bulk of the loss is occurring in the west antarctic ice sheet according to velicogna whose team used two satellites orbiting earth in tandem to gather data these satellites estimate earths global gravity field and variations in the gravity field over time were used to determine changes in earths mass distribution necessary for estimating changes in mass of the antarctic ice sheet the changes we are seeing are probably a good indicator of the changing climatic conditions there velicogna says the study seems to contradict the assessment by the intergovernmental panel on climate change which forecast that the antarctic ice shelf would actually gain mass in the st century due to higher precipitation in a warming climate the us researchers say the ipcc estimate was based on sparse coverage of coastal areas which would have affected the results twice the size of australia as earths fifth largest continent antarctica is twice the size of australia and contains percent of earths fresh water resources the ice sheet is an average metres thick research from the british antarctic survey suggests melting of the west antarctic ice sheet alone would raise global sea levels by more than metres up to of a cars fuel goes on running the airconditioning the average family car may one day have fans built into the seats to cool you down as you drive suggests us government research the cooled seats could also cut your fuel bill by more than say the researchers fuel that would otherwise be used to run the cars airconditioning ventilated seats keep drivers and passengers cooler so they need less airconditioning to be comfortable says the research team led by john rugh at the us department of energys national renewable energy laboratory the researchers have been trying to reduce fuel consumption for airconditioning in cars and trucks using a mannequin that breathes and sweats the researchers tested the effect of a specially constructed seat containing two fans that pull air from the seat surface and out from underneath the seat their mannequin called adam advanced automotive mannequin together with physiological and psychological models enabled the researchers to measure how the cool seats increases thermal comfort and reduces the need for airconditioning if all passenger vehicles had ventilated seats we estimate that there could be a reduction in national airconditioning fuel use the researchers say realworld savings australian engineer associate professor eric hu of deakin university in melbourne welcomes the research up to of the engine power is used for airconditioning purposes says hu who works on reducing fuel use associated with vehicle airconditioning while the cool seats might make people feel more comfortable he doesnt think the researchers estimate of a reduction in fuel consumption will make much difference in the real world certainly savings are a good thing but im not too sure you can say its significant he says hu says it would be easy to achieve the savings with good seals which would prevent the loss of cool air from windows and doors and if people dont close their windows tightly he says the savings could easily be blown away but hu says research like this is going in the right direction the amount of engine power used by airconditioning translates to at least of fuel use and of emissions hu says and until recently he says this problem has not been taken seriously for example he says airconditioning is not considered when the fuel economy of new cars is tested in australia driving uphill hus current research funded by the australian research council and airconditioning company air international is looking at how airconditioning affects fuel use under different driving conditions for example he has a theory that when a car full of passengers is driving uphill the engine can become overloaded and burn fuel inefficiently this means airconditioning would use even more fuel and worsen pollution hu is hoping to develop a smart energy management system for cars that could cut off airconditioning when the car is going uphill and let it kick in when the car is going downhill we want to coordinate the engine load and the airconditioning load he says currently these two systems are not talking to each other the la nia weather event which brings higher rainfall to australia may be on its way but the experts dont know how long it will last or what its effects will be la nintildea may be on its way says the uns weather agency an event that tends to bring aboveaverage rainfall to australia and parts of southeast asia the world meteorological organization wmo says it has seen unprecedented signs pointing to la nintildea which originates off the western coast of south america but can disrupt weather patterns around the globe the genevabased agency says temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial pacific have been between and degc below normal since the start of combined with broader tropical pacific ocean and atmosphere conditions this is consistent with the early stages of a basinwide la nintildea event it says it is unprecedented in the historical record for a la nintildea of substantial intensity or duration to develop so early in the year la nintildea which has the opposite effects to the more notorious el nintildeo last occurred from mid to early under la nintildea the seasurface temperature in the central and eastern tropical pacific falls below normal this typically brings far dryer weather to the southwestern us florida and western latin america and aboveaverage rainfall to australia indonesia malaysia and the philippines but there can also be a knockon effect much further afield with an increase to monsoon rainfall in south asia unusual coolness in tropical west africa southeast africa japan and the korean peninsula la nintildea usually lasts nine to months although some episodes may persist for as long as two years according to the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration hang on a minute but the wmo sounds a note of caution the buildup of this la nintildea is so exceptionally swift and intense that it is impossible at the moment to infer what the impact would be and how long the phenomenon would last it warns most models and expert interpretations favour the event dissipating quite rapidly over the next three to six months it says nonetheless neither a continuation of la nintildea beyond midyear nor the development of el nintildeo in the second half of can be ruled out as possible outcomes from the current prevailing situation el nintildeo which last ran from to occurs when warm water builds up in the western tropical pacific and creeps eastwards again causing huge disruption to classic patterns of rainfall and wind both el nintildeo and la nintildea are naturally occurring cycles although there is much speculation among climate scientists that human induced global warming may make them more frequent and more vicious and that this trend may have already started el nintildeo means the little boy in spanish its name is attributed to fishermen off the coast of south america who noted the appearance of warmer water often around christmas la nintildea means the little girl golf is hard enough to play well on earth so how is a russian cosmonaut going to hit a ball into the right orbit in space a russian cosmonaut plans to whack a golf ball into orbit from the international space station a publicity stunt that critics say would add to the growing problem of space junk pavel vinogradov is to take on the role of a celestial tiger woods under a deal between a canadian golf club manufacturer and the cashstrapped russian space agency in one of three space walks planned from the international space station over the next six months vinogradov will climb aboard a special platform and swing a special goldplated six iron and seek to enter the record books for the longestever golf drive if all goes well and nasa the prime agency in building and running the space station approves his ball will orbit the earth for about four years it would travel up to billion kilometres before eventually burning up upon friction with the atmosphere every single record for distance in the golf industry will be shattered says element golf co the toronto firm behind the scheme the ball will be fitted with a small radio transmitter allowing golf fans to track the ball on their home computer says the company which says it will give the club to charity scientists though are less than gleeful they say in theory it should be easy to hit the ball a huge distance after all us astronaut alan shepard exulted that his two historic golf shots on the moon where gravity is a sixth of the earths went miles and miles and miles on the space station orbiting the earth at a height of some kilometres gravity is negligible and friction is zero which should make it a golfers dream taking a shot but as experienced golfers will tell you driving that little white ball with the right force and in the right direction is a lot harder than it seems even on a terrestrial course the task is that much harder in a thick spacesuit which leaves little room for a decent swing or flexing the joints the ball thus could quite easily be mishit and travel only a couple of metres or be hooked or sliced and sent in entirely the wrong direction as a result it could accidentally land in the same orbital plane as the space station station and ball would both whizz around the planet on the same track one after the other and what that means is a remote risk of a collision capable of damaging or even destroying the space station depending on the angle velocity and site of impact theres a lot of room in space but orbital mechanics is a wonderful thing and things tend to come back to where you launched them from says dr heiner klinkrad acting head of space debris at the european space agency for the space station the most probable collision velocity in the worstcase scenario is somewhere at to kilometres per second he says this thing is certainly larger than a centimetre which means it would certainly penetrate the shields of the space station if it hits at this speed the perfect swing dr jeanmichel contant secretary general of the international academy of astronautics a parisbased forum on space research suggests that vinogradovs boots be strapped to the platform and that he make a few practice swings on a tethered ball before doing the big drive if safety criteria are respected this exercise could be useful as a teaching tool for children and students and be fun for the broad public he says but it holds out no scientific benefits and if the worstcase scenario happens it wont be fun at all another problem is that of space junk especially from exploded satellites and boosters which is becoming a threat to satellites and travellers the international recommendations are that you should not throw out unnecessary objects and i wouldnt qualify a golf ball as a missionrelated object klinkrad says junk in space the junk region of most concern is between and kilometres above earth where there are many navigation communication and weather satellites the golf ball would be far below this height dr bill ailor a director of the center for orbital and reentry debris studies at the aerospace corporation in el segundo california told new scientist magazine there are about operational satellites in this loworbit zone these could in theory be at risk from the ball as it slowly spirals towards earth but the chance of something like that happening is probably very low says ailor a nasa spokesperson says its engineers are vetting the planned golf drive for safety but was unable to say when this review would be completed new zealand fruits like fruits of the swamp maire shown here are rich in antioxidants scientists are finding this may help to explain low levels of infectious disease in preeuropean maori people plants traditionally eaten by maori people are the worlds richest source of antioxidants new zealand scientists show until now blueberries have been regarded as the king of the antioxidants the best source of antioxidants in a western diet and the standard by which theyre measured says associate professor kevin gould of the university of otago but almost half the plants we tested had concentrations many times higher says gould who measured levels in both native and introduced plants puha a plant similar to watercress and still commonly eaten by maori people has over three times the concentration of antioxidants of blueberries and new zealand honeysuckle times but the fruit of the syzygium maire or swamp maire tops the lot with times the concentration the study published in the new zealand journal of botany opens up several exciting avenues for further research gould says it may account for the low incidence of noninfectious disease in preeuropean maori even now maori are less at risk from colon and rectal cancers than new zealanders of european descent he says but it may also reflect the way new zealand plants are responding to global warming and other environmental stresses plants are particularly susceptible to stress from too much ultraviolet uv radiation because of the hole in the ozone layer above antarctica new zealand has one of the highest levels of uv radiation in the world under stress all organisms produce free radicals when they are stressed normally the organism can deal with them by producing its own antioxidants to mop up them up but too many antioxidants can cause damage a free radical is an unstable molecule that behaves irrationally says gould its a bit like a jilted lover bent on revenge wanting to attack the first thing it sees its unstable because its lacking an electron or its got too many so it just wants to grab one from anywhere including the tissue from your lung or your bowels finding plants with such high concentrations of antioxidants may prove doubly beneficial the researchers say they are potentially rich sources of dietary antioxidants and could provide a better understanding of how plants respond to environmental stress the suns next active period could by twice as energetic as the last one sunspawned cosmic storms that can play havoc with earthly power grids and orbiting satellites could be stronger in the next year solar cycle than in the last one scientists say using a new model that takes into account what happens under the suns surface and data about previous solar cycles astronomers say the next cycle could start as soon as this year or as late as they offer no specific predictions of solar storms but they hope to formulate early warnings that will give power companies satellite operators and others on and around earth a few days to prepare this prediction of an active solar cycle suggests were potentially looking at more communications disruptions more satellite failures possible disruptions of electrical grids and blackouts more dangerous conditions for astronauts says dr richard behnke of the upper atmosphere research section at the national science foundation predicting and understanding space weather will soon be even more vital than ever before behnke says the prediction roughly analogous to the early prediction of a severe hurricane season on earth involves the number of sunspots on the solar surface phenomena that have been monitored for more than a century twisted magnetic fields every years or so the sun goes through an active period with lots of sunspots this is important as solar storms linked to twisted magnetic fields that can hurl out energetic particles tend to occur near sunspots the sun is in a relatively quiet period now but is expected to get more active soon scientists say but scientists do not agree whether the active period will start within months late or early or years with the first signs in late or early whenever it begins the new forecasting method shows sunspot activity is likely to be stronger than the last active period the peak of the last cycle was in the researchers say but the period of activity can span much of a decade the strongest solar cycle in recent memory occurred in the late s when there were few satellites aloft no astronauts in orbit and less reliance on electrical power grids than now what would happen on earth if a similarly active period occurred now the impact would be hard to predict according to joseph kunches of the national oceanic and atmospheric administrations space environment center in colorado its pretty uncertain what would happen which makes this work more relevant kunches says what we have here is a prediction that the cycle is going to be very active and what we need and what were of course working on is to be able to predict individual storms with a couple days or hours in advance so the grids can take the action behnke says feeling ticklish most humans cannot tickle themselves because they anticipate their own actions which alters their sense of perception according to a new study since it is now believed that a breakdown in this anticipation process may underlie the delusions in schizophrenia the finding may also lead to a better understanding of this mental disorder its well known that you cant tickle yourself says associate professor randy flanagan one of the authors of the study published in the latest issue of the journal plos biology one explanation is that since all the sensations are completely predictable we do sensory attenuation which reduces our touch perception says flanagan a canadian psychologist at queens university in ontario if we try to deal with all the sensory information directed at us at any given time its overwhelming we cant focus attention on crucial changes in our environment that arent a function of our own motions scientists previously speculated that we either filter out unnecessary information after the motion or sensation occurs or that we predict our own actions this would allow us to mostly ignore unnecessary sensations such as the feel of our vocal chords while we speak or the constant tapping of our fingers while typing at a keyboard tap tap to determine which of the two mechanisms is at work the researchers asked righthanded people to tap with one index finger on a force sensor that was sandwiched between the tapping finger and the other hands passive index finger with each finger tap the sensor would deliver a tapping sensation to the passive finger similar to selftickling the test subjects reported that the tap received by the passive finger was weak because they had anticipated the sensation this occurred even when part of the force sensor was removed during surprise trials where the active finger just wound up tapping the air while the passive finger still received the expected tap we are constantly predicting the consequences of our actions flanagan says when we act on ourselves and on the world around us we predict in real time as we move hearing voices flanagan also explains that a breakdown in this prediction process could be why people with delusional schizophrenia hear voices and mumble to themselves if a healthy person murmurs to himself he knows that he is hearing his own voice flanagan says now imagine that the person has a deficit in the predictive mechanism he murmurs and then suddenly hears murmuring but cannot label it as himself as he tries to make sense of the alien voice the explanation for it could be quite bizarre such as thinking it is coming from a wall or the pavement he is not certain whether some people with schizophrenia can tickle themselves but since their falsely alien sensations are often accompanied by feelings of fear and paranoia it is likely that the experience would not be pleasurable impressed chris frith a professor of neuropsychology and deputy director of the leopold muumlller functional imaging laboratory at university college london says he is very impressed by the new study both frith and flanagan hope that the findings will help people with schizophrenia which the us national institute of mental health says affects around million people worldwide we need robust techniques for measuring the magnitude of the prediction breakdown if techniques like the one described in the plos biology paper can be used with patients then this will have a major impact on diagnosis and the monitoring of the effects of treatment frith says footprints from people running away from mount vesuvius when it erupted nearly years ago possibly part of a mass exodus mount vesuvius the volcano that buried pompeii and nearby towns in ad could erupt far more violently us and italian volcanologists have discovered based on evidence from a powerful earlier eruption the scientists say such an event could destroy villages and kill people as far as kilometres from its summit dr giuseppe mastrolorenzo of the vesuvius observatory in italy professor michael sheridan of the university of buffalo in new york and colleagues have found compelling evidence that nearly years ago vesuvius produced a most devastating eruption the event called the avellino catastrophe destroyed the area of presentday naples making bronze age farmers flee for their lives the researchers first examined the wellpreserved remains of nola a village about kilometres northeast of the volcano digging the ash layer left by the eruption they found evidence for a sudden en masse evacuation scenes of everyday life frozen by the volcanic deposits testify that people suddenly left the village the moulds of four huts with pottery and other objects left inside skeletons of a dog and nine pregnant goat victims found in a cage and footprints of adults children and cows filled by the first fallout pumice the researchers write in the current issue of the proceedings of the national academy of sciences one kilometre east of nola mastrolorenzos team found skeletons of a man and a woman buried under a metre of volcanic debris a dramatic evidence of their unlucky escape attempt and their death due to suffocation the eruption was probably preceded by a warning blast a kilometre column of ash and gas would have spewed high up into the atmosphere and then rained down covering about kilometres the scientists believe that most of the or so inhabitants of the area probably survived the eruption indeed they found thousands of footprints made in the ash all leading away from the volcano archaeological evidence indicates that some people returned and tried to set up settlements again it was a vain attempt as the deposit of millions of cubic metres of ash and small pumice fragments made the area uninhabitable for hundreds of years we have got to know vesuvius much better now we know that pompeii doesnt represent the worstcase scenario anymore says mastrolorenzo we need to incorporate the data of this prehistoric eruption into the hazard plan this is the most extreme scenario that could impact the city of naples and its surroundings an eruption similar to the avellino catastrophe today would affect an area much larger than the actual danger red zone which comprises a population of about and towns squashed within about a kilometre radius between the volcano and the sea indeed at least million people live within the area destroyed by the avellino eruption computer modelling shows that within a radius of at least kilometres from the volcano the impact force and sedimentation rate of the pyroclastic surge would cause total devastation and mortality because the inferred dynamic overpressure of surge clouds would exceed even the building strength say the researchers some kilometres away from the volcano most people would survive though there would still be risk of suffocating from the fine dust cloud because a volcanic crisis can start quickly leaving only a few weeks to months for planning it is important to use all available data to forecast the scale of potential events mastrolorenzo says catastrophes are often caused by the most extreme events a cycle of eruptions vesuvius is the only active volcano on the european mainland and erupts dramatically in cycles according to sheridan while there may not be a high probability that events like the avellino eruption or the pompeii eruption will occur in the near future italian authorities must still consider those possibilities there was this bronze age eruption about years ago and then years ago there was the ad event it seems that just about every years theres been a major eruption of this scale at vesuvius says sheridan using a standard statistical test there is more than a chance that a violent eruption will happen at vesuvius next year with each year that goes by the statistical probability increases he says do you metabolise caffeine quickly or slowly the answer could tell you about your risk of having a heart attack a gene that controls how fast your body breaks down caffeine might explain why some people can get away with drinking lots of coffee and others cant new research suggests people with a genetic variation linked with slow caffeine metabolism are more likely to have a nonfatal heart attack the researchers write today in the journal of the american medical association the researchers looked at people who lived in coffeerich costa rica between and half had had a nonfatal heart attack and half had not they found that slightly more than half had the slow version of the gene while the others had the fast form we found in individuals who had the slow version of this gene as little as two cups of coffee a day is associated with an increased risk of heart disease says study author dr ahmed elsohemy of the university of toronto for those with the slowacting gene two to three cups of coffee a day increased their odds of a heart attack by and four or more cups a day increased the risk by the study says for those who had the fast version of the gene there was no increased risk even with four or more cups a day he says surprisingly what we found was that in individuals under years of age who were fast metabolisers consumption of as little as one to three cups a day was associated with a lower risk of heart disease those with the fastacting gene who drank two to three cups of coffee a day had reduced odds of having a heart attack but drinking four or more cups a day lessened the risk by the study found initially we thought that individuals who had the slow version of this gene might drink less caffeine because it stays in their system longer elsohemy says but what we found is that regardless of the version of the gene that the person had it did not affect how much caffeine they consumed breaking down caffeine in the liver the enzyme cytochrome p a is responsible for metabolising caffeine in the liver and variations of the gene for this enzyme can slow down or speed up caffeine metabolism an individual cannot predict whether or not they have the slow or fast version of the gene because although they can feel the effects of caffeine on the nervous system they cannot feel the effects on their blood vessels elsohemy says since tests to determine which form of the gene you carry are not readily available and you cannot feel how fast your body is getting rid of caffeine the studys authors recommended reining in coffee consumption to no more than four cups a day previous studies have offered conflicting findings about the health effects of coffee and elsohemy notes other chemicals in coffee may play a role of all the studies that have been conducted to date that looked at the effects of either coffee or caffeine on heart disease none of them have taken into account genetic differences in the ability to break down caffeine elsohemy says we are approaching the era of personalised dietary advice are you looking at me more australian racehorses have visionthreatening eye disease than expected a new study shows about one in thoroughbred horses examined may be in danger of losing their sight cataracts corneal scarring and lesions are among the serious conditions that two veterinarians report in the latest issue of the journal veterinary ophthalmology dr simon hurn and colleague dr andrew turner say there is a perception in the racing industry that eye disease in horses is not very common but they had noticed a higher than acceptable level of eye disease in performance horses and were concerned when they couldnt find data to compare what they had found they decided to carry out their own research they conducted ophthalmic examinations on flatracing and jumpracing horses at four metropolitan and two country racing stable complexes in victoria they found potential visionthreatening eye disease in of the horses and nonvision threatening disease in generally horses eyesight is on par with that of humans the researchers say they probably dont have the same colour spectral type vision that we have but they do see colour and they do see movement and because they move at speed we can also assume they have good visual acuity sharpness as well says hurn he adds that many of the eye findings were incidental and wouldnt affect horses vision horses dont have to read newspapers or drive cars most of their time is spent eating or watching out for what they think are predators he says they can do that just fine with that vision that they have and the reason they dont have the same type of colour vision that we have is that they just dont need it their eyesight is good for their environment hurn says while there may well be a genetic component to the eye diseases in general he also believes vets are getting better at diagnosing eye disease we noticed a higher than normal incidence of cataracts in the population of horses however and this could certainly have a genetic component he says existing remote telecommunication networks are struggling to cope with todays internet traffic according to one expert so how about a new decentralised network remote communities could access cheaper wireless broadband services than their city cousins via newgeneration mobile phones and computers say australian researchers the devices could also be part of local community telecommunication networks independent of major centralised networks the researchers add dr mehran abolhasan of the university of wollongong is heading a team that will trial the new technology in a remote western australian community later this year remote communities still rely on outdated technologies and very lowcapacity networks that are not really able to provide todays internet traffic says abolhasan a telecommunications and computer engineering expert one of the main reasons for this is the enormous cost of rolling out links to the latest communications hubs in the cities and the low population in remote areas means the return on investment is quite low so despite government subsidies in australia for example remote communities have to pay more to get access to telecommunications than people in the city and they are often the least likely to be able to afford it ad hoc networks abolhasan hopes he has a lowcost alternative to providing uptodate telecommunications to remote communities his team is developing new software and hardware that can run what are called ad hoc networks the key components of the networks are small portable computer devices such as pcs or mobile phones that can transmit as well as receive microwave signals their ability to transmit means that as well as being a pc or mobile phone the devices can act as nodes in a communication network and if they are put on top of towers they can transmit messages over long distances especially when a number of them are linked in a chain ad hoc networking is cheap because of the low cost of the technology that enables wireless communication between different units says abolhasan and because much of the open source software is already freely available remote communities would have access to a broadbandtype service for a very low price he says cheaper than current broadband services in the city he says ad hoc networks have another advantage because they are not centralised and if devices break down they can communicate with other units and reroute messages extending existing networks abolhasan says ad hoc networking can extend the range of existing infrastructure for example if a remote community has a central building with access to a satellite network it can extend the satellite network to individual homes the technology could also be used to enable communications within a community for example people could run their own broadband television station from the local community centre you can have a community private network without going through any infrastructure says abolhasan the main research challenge is to increase the capacity of the technology which at the moment is unable to service large numbers of people at the same time he says the team plans to trial ad hoc networking in an indigenous community in western australia in the second half of this year if it works in outback australia it should work just about anywhere says abolhasan he says ad hoc networks dont need much power and could run on solar power he expects the technology to be available in the next three to five years the project is funded by the desert knowledge cooperative research centre in alice springs carbon dating is shedding new light on ancient scrolls and what they tell us about the history of buddhism rare manuscripts dubbed the dead sea scrolls of buddhism are indeed from the st and th centuries ad carbon dating shows the manuscripts which were written on fragile birch bark provide an important insight into the development of buddhist literature and help fill the gaps in some areas of buddhist history buddhism was traditionally a spoken tradition and until now little has been known about how it developed from the spoken to the written word while buddhism flourished throughout asia it disappeared from india central asia and the indonesian archipelago taking with it many literary traditions when we first learnt about these manuscripts we looked at the scripts and the language and made a rough estimate of their approximate age says dr mark allon from the university of sydney an australian researcher who is translating the text carbon dating conducted by researchers from the australian nuclear science and technology organisation confirmed the assessment the scientists used the process of accelerator mass spectrometry to radiocarbon date the bark on which the manuscipts were written this process counts the rare carbon isotopes in a sample and uses this to calculate the samples approximate age based on the radioactive decay over time two manuscripts from the senior collection which is named after the scrolls british owner date to between and ad and three manuscripts from the schoslashyen text named after the scrolls norwegian owner date to between the st and th century ad allon says the senior collection dating is particularly important because it makes a major contribution to indian buddhism chronology one of the manuscripts we studied was found in a pot with an inscription on it indicating that it was donated in the year while it didnt say what era that was the characteristics of the inscription tell us that it must refer to the kanishka era kanishka was a very important king in northern india in about the st or nd century ad but the dates he lived and ruled have been debated for a century or more what the carbon dates told us was that the earlier date favoured by some scholars namely ad is no longer tenable because the carbon dates tell us that the manuscripts actually dated from ad to ad the manuscripts are believed to have originated from afghanistan and are among many archaeological artefacts that were sold on the international market in times of war gammaray bursts like this are among the few things energetic enough to be seen from such a distance the discovery of the most distance and ancient stellar explosion has now been confirmed and pushed back another million lightyears to billion lightyears away the explosion known as grb took place when the universe was a relatively youthful million years old the fatal stellar scream beamed from a giant star as it collapsed to make a black hole contains direct clues to what the universe was like so long ago a gammaray burst or grb is one of the few things in the universe bright enough to be seen so long and far away three separate international teams of astronomers including observations from australias mount stromlo and siding spring observatories describe the grb in the journal nature today among them is assistant professor daniel reichart of the university of north carolina at chapel hill he began to suspect his team was seeing something unusual when the researchers detected the afterglow of the blast in infrared light but could not see it in visible light as is normally the case the gamma rays were initially detected from the spaceborne swift telescope and burst detector the rest of the observations were made from earthbound telescopes at that point we either had found the most distant burst in the universe or there was dust in the way reichart says could it be dust a careful analysis of just which wavelengths of light were missing from grb made it clear dust was not the culprit he explains dust scatters blue light out but its much more gradual says reichart grb s bluer light drops off very suddenly thats the signature of the light having been stretched out essentially making it redder called redshift over billions of years of travel through an expanding universe in a way its the wavelengths of light that didnt make it across time and space that pegged grb as the oldest and furthest star ever seen but the light that did survive the journey has a lot to offer as well its attraction lies in what it can reveal about star formation early in the history of the universe says astrophysicist dr enrico ramirezruiz of the institute for advanced study in princeton who writes about the importance of the discovery in the same issue of nature because all light when broken into a spectrum carries essentially a bar code of the elements that created or influenced it the light from grb could reveal a lot about where and when heavy elements become more common in the early universe distant galaxies are themselves difficult to study because they appear faint and small ramirezruiz explains grbs will serve not only as signposts to such galaxies but could be used to study the gradual buildup of heavy elements in them to determine the conversion history of primordial gas into stars the first generation of stars in the universe was made of hydrogen and helium alone heavier elements are made by the most massive stars when they die even at the colossal distance of billion lightyears grb is not quite old enough to be among the first generation of stars say astronomers thats because large stars that can create grbs have relatively short lifespans our sun in contrast is a mediumsized star which at about billion years old is only middleaged for its kind snuppy on the right with the threeyearold male afghan hound whose somatic skin cells were used to clone him two dna tests have backed claims by disgraced south korean scientist professor hwang woosuk that he made the worlds first

when the stem cell scandal broke one of the inquiries was conducted by a panel at the university where hwang carried out the work at the college of veterinary medicine nature says the panel had already announced in january that snuppy is believed to be a genuine clone this investigation was then doublechecked by genome specialists led by dr elaine ostrander at the us national institutes of health using samples provided by the seoul team the two investigations entailed making a dna fingerprint of snuppy looking notably for microsatellites telltale markers on the genome they then compared microsatellites between the puppy and his genetic donor a threeyearold afghan hound named tai the surrogate mother a yellow labrador retriever the unidentified donor of the egg and other pedigree dogs perfect match the tests showed a perfect match between snuppy and tai confirming that snuppy was created by placing tais dna in the empty donated egg the scientists say it is highly unlikely that snuppy came either from extreme inbreeding or from twinning says the seoul panel it is virtually certain that snuppy was generated from somaticcell nuclear transfer as claimed somaticcell nuclear transfer entails taking an egg and removing the nucleus which is then replaced by the nucleus of an adult cell taken from the animal to be cloned the reconstructed egg is then given a jolt of electricity or treated to a chemical cocktail to make it divide and placed in a bath of nurturing chemicals to continue growing the embryo is then placed in the uterus of a surrogate mother which if all goes well brings it to term this technique was used for the first cloned mammal dolly the sheep in and has been used on a dozen other species since then dogs though have been a big challenge because it is hard to acquire mature canine eggs in contrast to other mammals dogs ovulate when their eggs are immature the eggs then go to a special duct to mature for two or three days hwangs team cracked this problem by gently flushing out the oviduct to recover the mature eggs the technique could be useful for conservationists who want to preserve rare species whose eggs are difficult to harvest scientists say in trouble with stem cells hwang astonished gene scientists last may when he claimed to have created lines of stem cells that were identical to the dna of their donors but hwang plunged into disgrace when it was discovered that this research published in the journal science was fabricated similar accusations surround a science paper in which he claimed to have produced a stem cell from a cloned human embryo professor rusi taleyarkhan with his tabletop device that he says delivers cold fusion with bubbles a scientist who says he has achieved cold fusion using sound waves to make bubbles is being investigated by his current university after complaints from colleagues nuclear engineer professor rusi taleyarkhans work has been controversial since he published a study in claiming to have achieved the holy grail of energy production nuclear fusion at room temperature if scientists can duplicate the results and harness the technology which is based on the process that powers the sun tabletop fusion has the potential to provide an almost limitless source of cheap energy many labs are working frantically to try to do so but their efforts are difficult to substantiate and especially susceptible to being labelled as fraud taleyarkhan whose study was published while he was at the us department of energys oak ridge national laboratory in tennessee now works at purdue university in indiana and has also been trying to replicate his earlier findings he says he did this in purdue provost sally mason says her office is checking complaints from some of taleyarkhans coworkers purdue last week initiated a review of this research and these allegations mason says the research claims involved are very significant and the concerns expressed are extremely serious purdue will explore all aspects of the situation thoroughly and announce the results at the appropriate time she adds to ensure objectivity the review is being conducted by purdues office of the vice president for research which is separate from the college of engineering something amiss the journal nature reports today it has interviewed several of taleyarkhans colleagues who suspect something is amiss faculty members lefteri tsoukalas and tatjana jevremovic along with several others who do not wish to be named say that since taleyarkhan began working at purdue he has removed the equipment with which they were trying to replicate his work claimed as positive experimental runs for which they never saw the raw data and opposed the publication of their own negative results according to nature in addition brian naranjo at the university of california los angeles is submitting to physical review letters an analysis of taleyarkhans recently published data that strongly suggests he has detected not fusion but a standard lab source of radioactivity naranjos lab reported in april that it had achieved cold fusion by heating a lithium crystal soaked in deuterium gas engineers and physicists have been cautious about taleyarkhans technique but say in theory it could work in the original report in his original report published in the journal science in talayarkhan and colleagues say they created nuclear fusion in a beaker of chemically altered acetone by bombarding it with neutrons and then sound waves to make bubbles when the bubbles burst the researchers say they detected fusion energy the experiment used uranyl nitrate a salt of natural uranium experts have been especially sceptical about cold fusion claims since britons professor martin fleischmann and stanley pons of the university of southampton held a news conference in to claim they had achieved it fleischmann and pons were ridiculed when noone could duplicate their efforts a new type of tourism is taking off people with diabetes are flying to a clinic in mexico for an injection of pig cells hoping this xenotransplant will cure them but experts are worried about the risks involved with this socalled xenotourism or xenotravel both to the patient and to the rest of the community peta cook a phd student at queensland university of technologys centre for social change research will present her research on xenotourism at a meeting of the transplantation society of australia and new zealand in canberra later this month xenotourism is where someone specifically goes to another country for a xenotransplant the transplant of animal tissue or organs to treat conditions like diabetes australia currently bans xenotransplantation mainly because it could transfer infectious diseases from animals to humans in other countries such as the us clinical trials are being carried out under strict regulation but xenotransplants are available today to the general public for over us a the laboratorio de xenotransplantes in mexico has been offering pig cell transplants to the world since to treat diabetes cook says her correspondence with the clinic confirms patients from a country in the northern hemisphere were admitted in they confirmed with me that there were two people who had already received the therapy in january and february last year and since returned to their home country and they had two more people who were coming across to have a consultation cook says they were looking at doing about one a month as an international patient but of course that could be stepped up experts urge caution the international xenotransplantation association ixa says xenotransplantation might introduce new infections from animals so requires extreme caution the clinic in mexico states on its website that its pigs are raised in pathogen free farms and the isolated cells are examined to establish the levels of purity viability functionality sterility and then cultured before being transplanted the risk of infection is extremely low it states adding it has been authorised by a range of mexican government institutions but the international expert community is concerned theres no way of checking what mexico is doing they claim that they have approval from local and government authorities for this activity but there is no formal regulatory authority says professor anthony dapice of st vincents hospital in melbourne who is ixas immediate past president ixa and who are calling for the establishment of international standards on which animals can be used for xenotransplants and which tests should be carried out to ensure infection doesnt occur they also say patients given xenotransplants need to be monitored closely to see if they get sick afterwards while the clinic in mexico requires patients to visit their gp and endocrinologists in their home country other experts say this is not enough dapice says infectious diseases experts should be involved in the monitoring under the quarantine radar normally if you bring live animal material into australia it has to go through quarantine but when the animal material is inside someone its not exactly obvious there is no quarantine status that says you must declare that youve had a porcine transplant says dapice whose research involves genetically modifying pigs to stop rejection of their pancreas and kidney cells when they are transplanted into nonhuman primates if you go from the united states down to mexico have a transplant and fly back into the united states you dont tick on your immigration quarantine or any other form that youve been potentially exposed to this type of risk i think we place ourself at some risk from xenotourism while he is short on recommendations on what australia should do about this he says australia should help lobby at the international level for uniform standards but cook says we cant wait for international standards because xenotourism is already happening she says australia should address the issue now despite its moratorium which dapice predicts will be lifted in just two or three years the problem is though few people even in the expert community are even aware that xenotourism is happening says cook least of all gps who would be on the frontline of any fallout from xenotourism if i get a xenotransplant i could walk in to my doctor and have a sore throat and just be diagnosed with a sore throat and be told to suck on some lozenges when if fact i could have something a lot more serious going on she says dapice agrees this could be a problem a gp would have absolutely no idea about this he says the royal australian college of general practitioners was unavailable for comment sitting in cramped conditions on a longhaul flight isnt the main risk factor for dvt researchers say the cabin air quality may be to blame low cabin air pressure and poor oxygenation enhance the risk of deepvein thrombosis dvt in susceptible passengers a study suggests until now dvt has been most widely associated with remaining inactive for long periods like in the cramped conditions of an aircraft cabin but a study in todays issue of the lancet journal suggests there may be additional risk factors dvt occurs when a clot forms in leg veins during periods of sedentary activity the clot can then migrate to the heart lung or brain sometimes days or weeks later and inflict a heart attack or stroke even though the phenomenon has been known since world war ii it has in recent years become a major issue for the airline industry through lawsuits in which people who have had dvt place the blame on cramped economy seating in long flights the airlines retort that dvt can occur long after a flight which thus makes it impossible to establish a link and point out that clotting can occur in other forms of sedentary activity even from sitting and reading a book the latest research puts the ball back into the airlines court pointing the finger at cabin air quality as a potential risk factor a team led by professor frits rosendaal of leiden university medical center in the netherlands monitored levels of a key clotting protein called thrombinantithrombin tat complex among healthy men and women aged a total of of the people in the study were selected as they took the contraceptive pill had a gene variation called factor v leiden or both conditions which greatly increase the risk of blood clotting up up and away the volunteers were taken onboard a speciallychartered boeing for a nonstop eighthour flight it cruised at around metres with a cabin pressure that corresponds to an altitude of metres blood samples were taken before during and after the flight a couple of weeks later the same group underwent the same tests but this time at a movie marathon watching comedy and action films for eight hours they were not allowed to drink alcohol take aspirin or wear elastic stockings during the flight or the movies and were asked to remain seated as much as possible the group was monitored for the final time during eight hours of regular daily activity after the flight the concentration of tat complex rose by about on average across the group it fell by about after the cinema and by almost after the daily life experiment the postflight rise was overwhelmingly concentrated in just of the individuals especially those who took oral contraceptives and also had factor v leiden the findings suggest that flightassociated factors are the cause behind increased clot formation after a long trip say the team which conducted the study for the who the researchers put the ring of suspicion around hypobaric hypoxia a combination of low cabin pressure and a low oxygen level compared with terrestrial air conditions whos most at risk the data also provides a useful pointer for medical help to those most at risk there already exists an array of simple techniques or overthecounter drugs for combatting dvt these include cutting out alcohol on a flight stretching ones legs taking an aspirin and wearing compressive stockings that improve blood circulation there is also a powerful anticlotting prescription drug called heparin this medication has sideeffects which means it should be targeted at those most at risk such as women on the pill and with factor v leiden cancer patients and recent surgery patients says dr hans stricker a doctor at the charity hospital in locarno switzerland in a commentary previous studies have found a twotofourfold risk of dvt after air travel while a study in estimated that dvt may occur among one in every frequent longhaul air travellers in business class as well as economy plumes of icy material shoot out from the moons south pole one of saturns moons enceladus is spewing out a giant plume of water vapour that is probably feeding one of the planets rings scientists say the findings published in the journal science suggest that tiny enceladus could have a liquid ocean under its icy surface which in theory could sustain primitive life similar to jupiters moon europa the plume was spotted by cassini a joint useuropean spacecraft that is visiting saturn we realise that this is a radical conclusion that we may have evidence for liquid water within a body so small and so cold says dr carolyn porco cassini imaging team leader at the space science institute in boulder colorado however if we are right we have significantly broadened the diversity of solar system environments where we might possibly have conditions suitable for living organisms scientists have long known that many of saturns moons have water they took an especially close look at enceladus because it seemed to have a smooth surface suggesting recent geological activity that in turn could mean liquid water liquid water is a key requirement for life several moons have been found to have evidence of liquid water and the chemical elements needed to make life including europa gigantic geyser but scientists are far more intrigued by the plume itself a gigantic geyser of water vapour and tiny ice particles its basically this giant plume of gas coming out of the south pole of enceladus says dr candy hansen of nasas jet propulsion laboratory in california the plume is half the size of the moon its huge says hansen a planetary scientist water is being spewed out of this moon it solves some real mysteries that we have been struggling with over the years indirect observations have shown the moon discovered in by william herschel is rich in oxygen and hydrogen but whether this is because of water is not clear both water vapour and water particles were observed as well as a smattering of other compounds such as methane and carbon dioxide the international team of scientists reports in a series of papers in science it is possible the plume comes directly from ice but more likely there is a liquid source the researchers say it would have to be under the moons surface which is covered with ice if a wet domain exists at the bottom of enceladus icy crust like a miniature europan ocean cassini may help to confirm it dr jeffrey kargel of the university of arizona at tucson writes in a commentary might it be a habitat cassini cannot answer this question kargel adds any life that existed could not be luxuriant and would have to deal with low temperatures feeble metabolic energy and perhaps a severe chemical environment nevertheless we cannot discount the possibility that enceladus might be lifes distant outpost hansen is cautious i think the best you can say is there is biological potential we have liquid water probably and it is in contact with rocks so there are minerals she says and there is energy but we havent detected life the findings help to confirm theories that enceladus was the source of saturns outer ering the researchers say saturn has at least known moons enceladus is named after a titan in greek mythology who was defeated in battle and buried under mount etna by the goddess athena the new technology allows online gamers to talk and listen to others in a crowd online gaming characters will oneday have more realistic voices say researchers who are working on a system that makes nearby characters sound louder than distant ones the australian researchers say their technology will also make other forms of communication in the virtual world whether for work study or play more like real life dr paul boustead from the university of wollongong says this technology will be useful in the gaming world where players generally communicate by typing text to each other typing is quite demanding says boustead especially for those involved in some games that can have millions of active players boustead says the main problem with current voice over internet technology is that it is onedimensional there is no relationship between how someones voice sounds and the position they are at in the virtual landscape but in the new system a persons voice moves around with their online character this makes it possible to have multiple online conversations going on at the same time people can get closer to those they want to hear and move away from those they are less interested in hearing the idea is that you can walk into a virtual crowd says boustead you can talk to people just like in normal life in real life and its quite a comfortable way of communicating with people people are actually very used to it immersed in a virtual world for games and other virtual reality devices this means people can become even more immersed in their virtual world with our system you see through the eyes of your character you see these other characters which other people are controlling and you hear them from where they look like they are in the game says boustead so if someone is way up in front youll hear them just slightly off in the distance in the front he says if theyre right up close theyll be loud he says being able to talk to others in a crowd is important for players in computer games where cooperation with a small group within a crowd is crucial to winning it also means you can focus on the task at hand rather than typing to communicate in text says boustead he says the new technology could also be useful for virtual classrooms where students want to listen to the teacher and then form small discussion groups the technology could be useful for corporate meetings interactive online conferences or other events says boustead you could have a cocktail party online says boustead it could be kind of cool delivering the service the main restrictions on voice over internet has been a lack of bandwidth because having numerous voices and information that identifies their location in space involves a lot of data but boustead says his team has been developing technology that will allow such information to be sent via normal consumer broadband internet the system involves an audio server which creates audio scenes connected to devices on pcs telstra has been running a trial using the voice technology with several online computer games over the last few months with a small group of broadband users the research is funded by the smart internet technology crc laonastes is the only living representative of the otherwise extinct distomydae a family of rodents that lived in south asia and japan a squirrellike rodent found last year in laos has been identified as belonging to a family of rodents thought to have died out million years ago scientists says a team of us french and chinese researchers compared the live animals skeleton to the fossils of a family of rodents that lived in asia in the early oligocene to late miocene eras they confirm in the latest issue of the journal science that it belonged to the same mammalian family when the animal was discovered it made the headlines as biologists thought it belonged to a new family of animals rather than just a new species of an existing family they named it laonastes aenigmamus or laotian rock rat in fact it belongs to the family diatomyidae and resembles a small squirrel but is not a rat says palaeontologist dr mary dawson of the carnegie museum of natural history in pittsburgh pennsylvania diatomyidae lived during the middle tertiary period to million years ago in southern asia central china and japan they were medium sized rodents and had characteristic molar teeth and jaw structure the researchers say the rodent is an example of the lazarus effect when an organism suddenly reappears after a long gap in the fossil record finding an animal thought to be extinct is even more exciting than discovering a new species says dr george schaller the wildlife conservation society biologist who stumbled across the new animal last year the rodent is a nocturnal mammal that inhabits a remote laotian jungle and is known to local ethnic groups who call it khanyou scientist have been unable so far to see a live specimen the only one found had been killed by hunters and was put on sale at a local market where it was spotted by conservation society researchers the rainbow serpent a key aboriginal dreamtime creation symbol is closely connected with indigenous knowledge of groundwater systems indigenous australians dug underground water reservoirs that helped them live on one of the worlds driest continents for tens of thousands of years new research shows the study which is the first of its kind indicates aboriginal people had extensive knowledge of the groundwater system says hydrogeologist brad moggridge knowledge that is still held today some of the continent is covered by desert or semiarid land which meant its original inhabitants needed to know how to find and manage this resource if they were to survive aboriginal people survived on one of the driest continents for thousands and thousands of years says brad moggridge who is from kamilaroi country in northern new south wales without water you die they managed that water sustainably moggridge currently a principal policy officer in the new south wales department of environment and conservation did his research as part of a masters degree at the university of technology sydney he based his work on oral histories dreamtime stories rock art artefacts and ceremonial body painting as well as written accounts by white missionaries surveyors settlers anthropologists and explorers managing scant resources moggridge says indigenous australians channelled and filtered their water covering it to avoid contamination and evaporation they also created wells and tunnel reservoirs groundwater was accessed through natural springs or people used to dig tunnels to access it he says sometimes theyd dig till they found the water and then theyd build a system so they could access the water sometimes theyve go fairly deep and people would slither down there and get their water aboriginal people also used terrain birdlife vegetation and animals as markers for water moggridge says for example they followed dingos to rock pools and waterholes while ants led them to subterranean reservoirs they used the landscape he says for example youre in a dry area and all of a sudden theres a large number of ghost gums so youd think there must be some groundwater the dreamtime aboriginal peoples understanding of their groundwater system permeates dreamtime stories moggridge says for example the rainbow serpent is a key symbol of creation but its journey from underground to the surface also represents groundwater rising to the top via springs moggridge says european settlers owed their subsequent knowledge of groundwater to local tribes and trackers and even much of australias modern road system is based on water sources identified by the original inhabitants a lot of the old roads in new south wales are based on aboriginal walking tracks and their water supply would have been along the way he says the desert knowledge crc is also trying to link traditional knowledge with science in terms of water management in central australia home to numerous remote indigenous communities current projects include looking at the cultural values of water a spokesperson says letting worrying or persistent thoughts into your head before you go to sleep is the best way to avoid having dreams or nightmares about them advice to forget about your worries before bedtime can backfire according to new research an australian study has found that trying to banish unwanted thoughts like money problems or relationship dramas actually leads to having more dreams or nightmares the study published online in the journal behaviour research and therapy found the phenomenon more pronounced in people who tend to shut out their worries lead researcher professor richard bryant a psychologist from the university of new south wales and colleagues evaluated the effect of thought suppression on dreams in psychology students at the university the students were asked to nominate an unwanted thought that regularly intrudes their minds the group that actively suppressed the nominated thought just before dropping off to sleep reported more dreams featuring the unwanted thought compared to the group that did not suppress it bryant says that when the mind tries to block out unwanted thoughts it searches for alternative thoughts that prevent the unwanted thought from coming to mind distraction and monitors for any sign of the unwanted thought detection people who are highly anxious or have a lot of things on their mind the distraction process suffers allowing the detection process to predominate and they are going to think more about the unwanted thoughts he says theories suggest the tendency to suppress certain thoughts leads to a higher susceptibility to psychiatric difficulties that involve intrusive thoughts including depression anxiety and obsessional thinking in the extreme bryant says trying to suppress unwanted thoughts can lead to insomnia psychological distress and fear of going to sleep let the thoughts flow most modern therapies for anxiety disorders where thought intrusions are a core feature now concentrate on getting the person to focus on their intrusive thoughts rather than suppress them says bryant bryant points out that intrusive thoughts are not always negative teenagers not wishing to keep thinking about a girlfriend or boyfriend when they are meant to be concentrating on other things can find themselves dealing with the same paradox bryant says the research will help us to shed light on how to manage unwanted thoughts more effectively if you want to stop a thought bothering you the best thing you can do is let the subject pop into your mind rather than try to suppress it stem cells harvested from young womens menstrual blood have a longer lifespan than those from older women japanese researchers have harvested stem cells from human menstrual blood a medical conference has heard the researchers say these stem cells could be coaxed into forming specialised heart cells which might oneday be used to treat failing or damaged hearts at the meeting of the american college of cardiology dr shunichiro miyoshi reported that he and his colleagues at keio university in tokyo collected menstrual blood from six women and harvested stem cells that originated in the lining of the uterus they were able to obtain about times more stem cells from menstrual blood than from bone marrow miyoshi says the stem cells were then cultured in a way to induce them to become heart cells after five days about half of the cells contracted spontaneously rhythmical and synchronously suggesting the presence of electrical communication between the cells miyoshi says that is to say they behaved like heart cells the researcher explains that already stem cells derived from bone marrow have improved heart function mainly by producing new blood vessels rather than new heartmuscle tissue he emphasises that it is important that these cells be obtained from younger patients because they would have a longer lifespan than cells harvested from older donors this exoplanet is times the mass of earth and is shown here with a hypothetical moon a cold heavy superearth has been found orbiting a distant star using a method that holds promise for detecting faraway planets that closely resemble our own astronomers say the planet weighs times as much as earth and is orbiting a star about lightyears away but instead of circling close to its star as earth does this superearth is about as distant from its star as jupiter and saturn are from the sun an international team of scientists says the new planet probably has a temperature of minus degc making it one of the coldest planets detected outside our solar system the discovery is billed as a superearth because it is thought to be a rocky terrestrial planet like earth even though it is much more massive the planet was detected by astronomers using a project called ogle short for optical gravitational lensing experiment which looks for changes in light coming from distant stars if another star passes between the faraway star and a telescope on earth the gravity of the intervening star acts like a lens and magnifies the incoming light when a planet is orbiting the closer star the planets gravity can add its own distinctive signature to the light this phenomenon is known as gravitational microlensing and it has the potential to detect less massive planets than other methods of searching for planets around other stars lots of superearths the ogle project detected the microlensing event in april a total of astronomers working with ogle found the signs of a planet lightyears away in the direction of the milky ways central galactic bulge a lightyear is about trillion kilometres the distance light travels in a year professor andrew gould of ohio state university who heads the planethunting group microfun short for microlensing followup network says this discovery has two implications first this icy superearth dominates the region around its star that in our solar system is populated by the gasgiant planets jupiter and saturn gould says weve never seen a system like this before because weve never had the means to find them and second these icy superearths are pretty common roughly of all stars have them the researchers report their find on arxiv a website run by cornell university in the past decade scientists have detected some socalled extrasolar planets using a variety of techniques the vast majority are gas giant planets like jupiter that are hostile to life as it is known on earth in january a planet about fiveandahalf times earths mass circling a star near the center of the milky way was detected using gravitational microlensing a circular shape protects certain proteins from being chewed up by enzymes so could these supertough proteins be used to deliver drugs humans appear to have lost what may have been a natural resistance to hiv some million years when our bodies stopped producing particular kinds of protein an australian scientist says these circular proteins called cyclotides were discovered by professor david craik from the university of queensland and colleagues about years ago craik reports new insights into these molecules in the current issue of the journal science the first cyclotide discovered in mammals rtd was found in rhesus monkeys and when chemically synthesised acts against hiv craik says humans have the genetic material to produce rtd but we dont make it because during evolution we apparently developed a mutation which put a stop code on its production it seems that somewhere between and million years ago some primates retained this mutation craik says its an ironic twist of fate because if it wasnt for that mutation you and i would have a gene that would produce a potent antihiv agent the discovery could also explain why some people have apparent immunity to hiv craik says there may be some populations that dont have the stop code he says help during childbirth craick reported his discovery of the first cyclotide in after analysing a small circular protein from a medicinal tea given to congo tribeswoman during childbirth we discovered that this molecule had a circular backbone and a knotted arrangement that made it virtually indestructible he says it was completely resistant to enzymes and boiling we thought it was unusual that a protein could be so stable and thats why we tried to find out the structure almost all of the or so cyclotides discovered so far have come from plants animals and bacteria cyclotides his investigations show that while normal proteins are a linear chain of amino acids cyclotides have stitched up ends that protect them from degradation there are a lot of enzymes around whose job it is to degrade proteins he says they target the ends of proteins and chop away at the ends cyclotides are therefore resistant to degradation because they are joined from head to tail to form a circle cyclotides are also naturally occurring compared to other small circular proteins or cyclic peptides which have either been physically manipulated in the lab or arranged by a chemical interaction in the body craik says some of these peptides have been identified as promising drug leads but they fall down as medicines because they basically get chewed up by enzymes once theyre swallowed as far as your bodys concerned a protein drug is the same as a piece of steak all it wants to do is chew it up he says but natural cyclotides can be toxic delivering drugs craik says the solution is to chemically engineer cyclotides to remove their toxicity then graft active peptides onto them using the construct to deliver drugs were engineering out the toxic effects and engineering in the biological activity he says craik is working on this principle using plant cyclotides and is currently commercialising a drug for multiple sclerosis tiny speck of comet dust less than micrometres long and its track embedded in lowdensity glass scientists studying comet samples returned by the stardust spacecraft have uncovered a cosmic conundrum how did minerals that form in extremely hot temperatures end up inside an icy comet when they formed they were either redhot or whitehot and we found them in the siberia of the solar system says stardust lead scientist professor donald brownlee with the university of washington the stardust spacecraft was launched in february and flew by comet wild pronounced vilt five years later the comet formed in the frigid kuiper belt region located beyond neptunes orbit and was a relatively new traveller to the inner solar system when it encountered the nasa probe samples from the comet were collected by the spacecraft in trays of exposed gel and returned to earth in january the discovery of exotic hightemperature minerals rich in calcium aluminum and titanium complicate generally accepted theories about how comets form far from simple icy bodies with clouds of gas and dust comets or at least comet wild now appear to be a blend of materials formed at all temperature ranges forging metals brownlee and other stardust researchers expect to learn whether the hightemperature metals were forged near the center of the nebular cloud that eventually became our solar system or whether they come from another star if it was formed in our solar system then it had to be transported from the hottest regions to the coolest says brownlee the samples also show a rich supply of olivine an ironmagnesium blend of minerals which on earth can be found in peridot gemstones and in the green sand on some hawaiian beaches though it is one of the most common minerals in the universe scientists did not expect to find it in a comet olivine forms in temperatures of about degc which means the mineral would have had to form closer to the sun than mercury and then somehow be flung out more than times the distance of the sun to earth researchers plan extensive studies to determine the chemical histories of the sample particles which will eventually reveal whether the grains came from our solar system or another star we will know soon brownlee said at the annual lunar and planetary institutes science conference which opened this week between and samples from the comet are currently circulating among scientists and research labs across the world next month work begins on another set of samples collected during the mission interstellar dust grains unlike the comet samples the bits of interstellar dust picked up during stardusts travels are tiny scientists plan an internetbased detection program of volunteers who will use their home computers to scrutinise images and try to identify any particles the project called stardusthome begins in april this falsecolour image of earth shows heat escaping to space greenhouse gases trap such heat to warm the planet greenhouse gases in reached their highest ever levels in the atmosphere says the uns meteorological agency a bulletin from the world meteorological organization wmo says the gases carbon dioxide co methane and nitrous oxide all reached new highs in officials also indicate that a near record yearonyear rise in co levels for recorded by us monitors well above the average for the past years would not come as a major surprise global observations coordinated by wmo show that levels of co the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere continue to increase steadily and show no signs of levelling off says wmo secretarygeneral michel jarraud in its first greenhouse gas bulletin to be an annual publication the wmo says that in atmospheric co levels stood at parts per million higher than in the preindustrial age before about methane has risen in the modern age the wmo says but its growth is slowing and nitrous oxide is rising consistently with levels increasing in modern times the wmo says these three gases alone contribute to about of warming over the same period the average annual increase in absolute amounts of co in the atmosphere over the past decade has been parts per million slightly higher than the parts per million of says wmo environment division chief dr leonard barrie barrie says reports by national oceanic and atmospheric administration that co had grown last year by parts per million had to be viewed in perspective it is important to take the long view there can be fluctuations he says the parts per million figure is within past experience if it were to persist over several years then we would have to start talking about what it means recurrent miscarriages could be prevented if women prone to thrombophilia are given the correct treatment new research finds women who have had recurrent miscarriages should be checked for a tendency to develop blood clots as treating the condition halves their risk of further pregnancy loss a new study has found australian researchers followed couples who had had at least three miscarriages they found that screening the women for thrombophilia a tendency to develop blood clots and giving them prophylactic antithrombotic therapy halved their future chances of losing a pregnancy professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the university of adelaide gus dekker says the women were screened for thrombophilia insulin resistance and elevated homocysteine levels we found that if you do nothing these women can expect a to chance of a further miscarriage he says but if you treat them the pregnancy loss rate is halved to there is light on the horizon for women who have recurrent miscarriages as proper analysis and treatment can increase the chance of having a healthy baby from to antithrombotic therapy includes aspirin plus low molecular weight heparin treatment for elevated levels of homocysteine which is another risk factor for clotting is vitamins including folate and vitamin b professor dekker presented findings at the recent human reproductive health through the ages conference in adelaide he says the data literature and the researchers own experience indicate that screening identified major risk factors in of recurrent miscarriage cases we can modify most of these risk factors such as insulin resistance and thrombophilias he says he advises these women should be referred to an obstetrician with a special interest in the area dekker says women who had had three miscarriages or women in their mids who had had two and did not have a condition known as a blighted ovum could be referred women with a personal or family history of thrombophilia could also be referred as could women with a history of preeclampsia or unexplained preterm birth most thrombophilias affect the early development of the placental circulation so treatment to prevent thrombosis and possibly provide an antiinflammatory effect can stop the process he says the same mathematical used to schedule trains are being used to prioritise the allocation of scarce conservation dollars scientists are using mathematical formulae normally used by economists and engineers to work out which of the worlds biodiversity hotspots to save first ecologist and mathematician professor hugh possingham and team at the university of queensland report their research in todays issue of the journal nature since the s global conservation agencies have identified particular areas around the world that are rich in species but under threat from habitat destruction but there are many such biodiversity hotspots that need attention and a limited budget to save them until now says possingham there hasnt been a rational way of prioritising where to act first do you act in them all simultaneously do you try and pick out three of them and how long do you spend acting in one before you move to another possinghams team has applied mathematical tools regularly used by economists and engineers to find the optimum way to answer these questions the tools run our entire economy they schedule all the airlines they schedule all the trains says possingham any transportation organisation is using optimisation methods to work out which trucks should go where at what times he says in this case the tools are applied to saving as many species as possible in a sense its not that much more than third year or fourth year applied maths or economics at university says possingham but the kind of people working in these conservation fields often dont have these skills so they often thought about formulating the problem properly prioritising hotspots possinghams team has developed a method of prioritising hotspots that take into consideration a range of features apart from how many species an area has high priority is given to areas where habitat is fast disappearing little of the area has already disappeared and where the cost of conserving habitat is low another factor that influences the priority given to an area is how likely it is to conserved in the future if you are going to invest in a place where youre not sure that youll get the investment youre not sure the national park will stay a national park youd want to get a lot more benefit out of that investment says possingham youre willing to pay higher prices for places that are secure he says this is exactly the same as tradeoffs made in the share market where you expect a higher outcome for highrisk investments and a lower outcome for lowrisk ones the team is currently working with conservation international and the nature conservancy to help establish conservation priorities across the globe so far possingham and team have tested their method on five areas in south east asia and found that sulawesi would be a higher priority than sumatra borneo java and malaysia supermarket databases could be vulnerable to virus attacks causing chaos at the checkout cheap radio chips that are replacing the ubiquitous barcode are a threat to privacy and susceptible to computer viruses scientists say and a deliberate virus attack could potentially cause chaos at airports and supermarkets researchers at amsterdams free university created a radio frequency identity rfid chip infected with a virus to prove that rfid systems are vulnerable despite their extremely low memory capacity the problem is that an infected rfid tag which is read wirelessly when it passes through a scanning gate can upset the database that processes the information on the chip say the study authors everyone working on rfid technology has tacitly assumed that the mere act of scanning an rfid tag cannot modify backend software and certainly not in a malicious way unfortunately they are wrong they say an rfid tag can be infected with a virus and this virus can infect the backend database used by the rfid software from there it can be easily spread to other rfid tags as a result they say it is possible that criminals or militants could use an infected rfid tag to upset airline baggage handling systems with potentially devastating consequences the same technology could also be used to wreak havoc with the databases used by supermarkets this is intended as a wakeup call we ask the rfid industry to design systems that are secure says author professor andrew tanenbaum with rfid anything from shampoo bottles to marathon runners can be tracked using radio tags civil liberty groups say rfid could lead to an unacceptable invasion of privacy and argue that airline ticket information could be used by law enforcement agencies and divorce lawyers industries in which tracking goods is crucial such as pharmaceuticals governments logistics airlines and manufacturing already use rfid technology the concaveeared torrent frog needs to shout to be heard over the sound of rushing water it uses a form of communication before now only seen in mammals a rare frog uses ultrasound to communicate a clever tool that helps it overcome the noise of the waterfalls it lives in researchers say the concaveeared torrent frog amolops tormotus is the first nonmammalian species known to use the ultrahigh frequencies that humans cannot hear it joins bats dolphins and whales and a small number of rodents in the elite club of creatures that can communicate this way a us and chinese team reports its find today in the journal nature professor albert feng of the university of illinois and team found that male frogs of the species make highpitched melodic birdlike calls the calls sometimes exceeded their recorders maximum range of kilohertz more than six times the limit of human hearing the frogs inhabit huangshan hot springs a popular mountainous area west of shanghai where there are loud waterfalls and streams the high frequencies provide a channel of communication that cannot be disrupted by the lowerfrequency rumble of the water says feng nature has a way of evolving mechanisms to facilitate communication in very adverse situations he says one of the ways is to shift the frequencies beyond the spectrum of the background noise mammals such as bats whales and dolphins do this and use ultrasound for their sonar system and communication frogs were never taken into consideration for being able to do this the discovery also answers a puzzle as to why the frogs do not have external eardrums thin eardrums are needed for detection of ultrasound says feng recessed ears shorten the path between the eardrums and the ear enabling the transmission of ultrasound to the ear ultrasounds are highpitched sounds with a frequency of more than kilohertz much higher than the frequency most birds reptiles and amphibians can hear long single strands of dna plus strengthening shorter strands were used to make this image a nanotechnologist has created the worlds smallest and most plentiful smiley a tiny face measuring a few billionths of a metre across assembled from strands of dna dr paul rothemund at the california institute of technology can make billion smileys each a thousand times smaller than the diameter of a human hair with his technique dna has long been known for its versatility as a microscopic building block the molecule can be cut using enzymes and reassembled using matching rungs in its doublehelix structure this theoretically opens the way to making dna quantum computers and nanolevel devices including injectable robots that can monitor the bodys tissues for good health but until now nanoassembly has been a complex atombyatom procedure that is also costly because it is carried out in a vacuum or at extremely coldly temperatures rothemund writing in todays issue of the journal nature describes a far simpler and much cheaper process in which long single strands of dna can be folded back and forth to form a basic scaffold the basic structure is then supplemented by around shorter strands which both strengthen it and act rather like pixels in a computer or tv image thus providing a shape that can bear a complex pattern in a potent demonstration of his socalled dna origami technique rothemund has created half a dozen shapes including a fivepointed star a snowflake a picture of the double helix and a map of the americas in which one nanometre represents kilometres rothemund has been working on flat twodimensional shapes but says that d structures in dna should be quite feasible with this technique one application would be a nanoscale cage in which pharmaceutical researchers working on novel drugs could sequester enzymes until they were ready for use in turning other proteins on and off whether your brain triggers you to act violently or not is determined by a complex mix of genes and environment people who are genetically predisposed to violence have a different brain structure to others a new study suggests dr daniel weinberger of the us national institute of mental health and team report their findings in todays issue of the proceedings of the national academy of science our data identify neural mechanisms associated with one specific gene epidemiologically associated with risk for violent and impulsive behaviour they say the gene which is carried on the x chromosome produces an enzyme that mops up stress hormones in the brain some researchers suggest that a certain form of this monoamine oxidase a maoa gene is linked to violent behaviour according to australian neurogeneticist professor peter schofield the most profound demonstration of the link was a study more than years ago of a rare family in the netherlands that had a catastrophic mutation in that gene all the males in that family with that mutation were arsonists and rapists says schofield who heads the prince of wales medical research institute in sydney in addition he says animal studies have shown that mice without an maoa gene have aggressive tendencies these drastic exceptions aside the maoa gene occurs naturally in all of us in one of two forms one that expresses the enzyme at very low levels and one that expresses it at high levels some researchers think that there might be a correlation between the lowexpressing form and violent behaviour but a study done a few years ago of men born in the new zealand city of dunedin found no direct link between the gene form and violent behaviour what they did find was an indirect link those men who had the lowexpressing version of the maoa gene and had been abused as children were far more prone to violent behaviour now weinberger and team have tried to find out more about how this complex interaction of genes and environment works the study weinberger and team studied the genes and brains of healthy men and women who had no history of violence the researchers showed the study participants pictures of angry and fearful faces and monitored the structure and function of their brains using magnetic resonance imaging they found those with the lowexpressing version of maoa were more impulsive parts of their brain associated with emotion differed in size and activity to those with the highexpressing version the study also found that activity of those parts of the brain in males with lowexpression maoa differed more greatly than their female counterparts weinberger and team say their work sheds light on the neural mechanisms involved in genetic predisposition to violence and it could help in finding ways to combat violence using biological approaches but they emphasise the genetic contribution to violence is small nature and nature schofield welcomes the new research saying it builds on the previous dunedin study by exploring how genes and environment can interact its neither nurture nor nature it is a complex mixture of both he says schofield says the main weakness of the study is that it studied normal people and extrapolated what this might mean for violent people he says the obvious next step would be to see if the results held true for a group of people who had a history of violent crime but he says if the emotional seat of the brain is involved it suggests that cognitive behavioural therapy may be a useful tool to counter violent behaviour neuroscientist professor lesley rogers of the university of new england in armidale also welcomes the study this expression of maoa form is really important in terms of how a brain will deal with a social situation whether a person will go over the top or not says rogers who has written extensively on the relationship between genes and environment the deep sea is rich in unusual creatures that biotech companies are keen to exploit this hydrothermal vent for example is home to riftia tubeworms mussels and scavenging crabs biotechnology companies are profiting from living resources found in the deep ocean without laws to ensure their actions are sustainable and fair says an australian environmental lawyer dr david leary of macquarie university in sydney says his research has revealed there are six companies selling products derived from the deep ocean and another eight developing them they are the main players in the biotech industry theyre north american and european companies he says leary says while international laws cover mining in the deep sea noone is mining there yet but we have bioprospecting and exploitation of the genetic resources of the deep sea beyond national jurisidiction says leary who describes the deep sea as one of the worlds last remaining commons people are making a profit now he says leary says national scientific research organisations in japan france us russia australia canada and new zealand are also involved in bioprospecting in the deep sea he says biotech companies rely on these public organisations for access to deepsea resources because the companies dont own the specialised equipment needed to explore the deep sea what is difficult because of commercial confidentiality is getting a handle on how close industry is to government science says leary cosmetics drugs industrial enzymes he says there are patents filed in europe and the us on derivatives of deepsea organisms there are cosmetics on sale derived from microbes that survive in extreme environments found deep below the surface of the ocean says leary and enzymes from the same source are used in industrial processes and research a french government agency is currently testing a bonehealing drug also made from these extremophiles he says and there is research into developing artificial blood from the haemoglobin of tubeworms found around deepsea hydrothermal vents there is also research on chemicals from corals on deepsea mounts says leary part of the maldives island chain from space nearly people were killed here following the tsunami and over were displaced some of the lowlying islands of the maldives grew taller as a result of the deadly indian ocean tsunami a new study has found dr paul kench of the university of auckland in new zealand and team report their findings in the march issue of the journal geology despite the disastrous effects of the tsunami on humans and manmade structures in the maldives less than of the land area was significantly changed by the tsunami say the researchers a beforeandafter study of small islands suggests that the lowlying coral atolls are tougher than they look we looked for any evidence of change says kench he and his team had already surveyed small islands in the maldives before the tsunami in and so they were in a perfect position to assess the effects of the tsunami the first thing kench and his team discovered was that the tsunami was not nearly as high at the maldives as along other coasts thats because there is no continental shelf along which the waves could build up and break instead says kench the highest in the series of waves from the great sumatraandaman earthquake were only about metres which washed over the to metrehigh islands and then kept racing toward africa there werent these thundering walls of water crashing across the islands says kench nevertheless they all went underwater the islands were also spared any backwash which doubled the scouring effect elsewhere kench says on the contrary the tsunami scoured only the eastern sides of the islands where it struck and carried the coral beach sand over the islands as much as centimetres of sand was deposited on top of one island with the others gaining to centimetres it just added freeboard says kench the bottom line he says is that geologically speaking the tsunami was anything but a destructive event for the island landmass of the maldives i think its a quite useful paper says marine geologist dr chris perry at manchester metropolitan university in the uk the island response is fairly minimal but its not clear whether it offers any clues to how the maldives or other atolls will withstand rapid rises in sea level due to the melting of glaciers by global warming we dont know the rates of reef growth says perry and theres also the fact that many atolls are now suffering from coral bleaching which stops growth altogether just like her screen depiction by movie star elizabeth taylor cleopatra knew all about power hair egyptian queen cleopatra used her hairstyles to enhance her power and fame says a professor of art history and classics statues coins and other existing depictions of the queen suggest cleopatra bc wore at least three hairstyles professor diana kleiner of yale university says in a new book the first a travelling do that mimicked the hair of a macedonian greek queen involved sectioning the hair into curls which were then often pulled away from the face and gathered into a bun at the back the next was a coiffure resembling a melon and the third was the regal cleopatra in her royal egyptian headdress complete with a rearing cobra made of precious metal cleopatra did not invent any of these styles but she used them to her advantage kleiner indicates in her book cleopatra and rome ptolemaic trendsetters from the time of egyptian king ptolemy i the ptolemaic queens wore the melon hairstyle with its segmented sections resembling a melon or gourd kleiner says when cleopatra followed suit she was more traditionalist than trendsetter these same ptolemaic queens were also depicted in art with the usual egyptian wigged headdress that had its origins in pharaonic times cleopatra did as well so again she followed tradition and did not innovate when it came to hair but kleiner says cleopatra appears to have worn different coiffures in different circumstances playing to her audience so to speak in life and in art kleiner says when the queen was in her homeland her likely objective was to look like a traditional egyptian ruler although she was in fact greek and to legitimise the ptolemaic dynasty by linking it to the time of the pharaohs a group of egyptian statues recently has been linked to cleopatra although the identification cant be proved since there are no accompanying inscriptions these show her with the customary egyptian wig and the triple uraeus rearing cobra she says this egyptian coiffure is the one we most often associate with cleopatra today think elizabeth taylor divine ornaments the uraeus was associated with a cobra goddess wadjyt the sun god ra and the goddess hathor so wearing it signified that the individual had taken on the attributes of a divinity cleopatra also probably often wore the melon hairstyle in egypt where she had many slaves to attend to her appearance including some that were responsible for maintaining the royal wigs the egyptian queen extensively travelled and did so in style not unlike film depictions cleopatra would arrive via elegant barge with her attendants catering to her every need in rome kleiner believes cleopatra wore her hellenistic travelling coiffure in places where it would be seen and gossiped about at cocktail parties at about the same time kleiner notes the melon hairstyle turns up in roman portraiture which suggests roman women admired cleopatra and attempted to copy her nodus operandi roman leaders octavian antony and julius caesar seduced the egyptian queen kleiner suggests that octavia antonys wife invented a hairstyle called the nodus to compete with cleopatra the nodus featured a roll over the forehead that kleiner says may have mimicked cleopatras wellknown rearing cobra the nodus was the height of roman fashion in the s bc just before cleopatras death by suicide at the age of karl galinsky distinguished professor of classics at the university of texas at austin says he agrees that cleopatra wore different looks including calculated hairstyles he says they were designed to convey a message and cleopatra may have had different hair days in different countries drug research company parexel carried out a drug trial that went horribly wrong could it happen in australia as doctors scramble to understand what caused the catastrophic reaction to a drug given in a uk trial researchers say the possibility of something similar happening in australia cant be ruled out british experts are baffled about why six healthy volunteers suffered a massive reaction shortly after being given the antibody drug tgn last week two remain critically ill and four are seriously ill two others who received a placebo escaped harm its believed differences between a cellsignalling protein in humans and animals may explain the unexpectedly severe reaction in the previously healthy young men who were paid for their participation they were the first humans to receive the drug designed to treat leukaemia and chronic inflammation disorders australian clinical trials experts say we should learn a lesson from the uk experience and consider more sophisticated ways of trialling potentially dangerous new drugs dr chris karapetis a principal investigator in several clinical trials in oncology at flinders medical centre in adelaide says australian trials are subject to rigorous ethical and scientific scrutiny but risks remain obviously you cannot rule out the possibility of there being an adverse reaction in a trial of this nature he says one of the things that is crucial is that all potential risks are explained to patients and when its a new drug the risk that there could be a side effect that develops thats unknown what went wrong doctors say they have never before seen a reaction such as occurred during the trial of tgn made by privately owned german company tegenero ag us drug research company parexel was running the trial on behalf of tegenero dr thomas hanke chief scientific officer at tegenero says previous tests on animals hadnt produced drug related adverse events or drugrelated deaths tgn belongs to a class of drugs known as monoclonal antibodies which specifically bind to target molecules tgn targets an immune system protein called cd cd is a protein on the surface of some white blood cells that plays a part in activating them for an immune response hanke says tgn was designed to activate its target protein rather than blocking it as many antibody drugs do dr david glover a uk drug industry consultant with extensive experience of antibody treatments says the protein the drug targets may not be the same in all species i suspect the antibody was designed to work against human cd and because it was designed to work best in humans its performance in different animals may fall short of what you might have expected in humans he says that is why the animal testing may have falsely provided reassuring results it could be one of the explanations what can australia do australian clinical pharmacologist professor paul rolan of the university of adelaide has introduced new molecules into humans during years of clinical trials he says tgn is different to many other drugs because it has a very specific target in the body such magic bullet drugs can be very specific to humans and may not cause adverse reactions in animals used in preclinical trials he says rolan says the way we do trials may need to become more sophisticated as we search for more specific and powerful drugs rather than testing these sorts of drugs in animals we may have to use animals that have been genetically modified to make them more like humans he believes australia has the expertise to do these sort of trials the garvan institute of medical research in sydney says it is already using these methods in a statement the garvan says australian clinical trials have a fantastic record it is absolutely vital that both volunteers and patients continue to agree to participate in clinical trials for new medicines it says whats the future for antibody treatments glover says no one should lose sight of the benefits of antibody drugs he says the focus shouldnt be on antibody treatments in general or stopping clinical trials the breast cancer drug herceptin made by the swiss pharmaceutical roche is an antibody treatment it attaches itself to the her receptor on the cancer cells and blocks them from receiving growth signal eighteen antibody products have been approved for sale and their combined worldwide sales reached us billion a billion last year but glover says trials of drugs targeting the protein cd should be reviewed should we stop doing trials that are directed against the target cd i think the answer is yes until more is known about what it going on he says the uks medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency is conducting an enquiry into what went wrong and results are expected in the coming weeks will bird flu vaccines be out of date by the time they are ready for use the hn bird flu in humans has evolved into two separate strains a development that will complicate the search for a vaccine and the prevention of a pandemic us researchers report the genetic diversification of the pool of hn avian influenza viruses with the potential to cause a human influenza pandemic heightens the need for careful surveillance researchers said at the international conference on emerging infectious diseases in atlanta back in we only had one genetically distinct population of hn with the potential to cause a human pandemic now we have two says dr rebecca garten of the us centers for disease control cdc who helped to conduct the study one of the two strains or clades made people sick in vietnam cambodia and thailand in and and the second a cousin of the first caused the disease in people in indonesia in two clades may share the same ancestor but are genetically distinct as are different clades or strains of hiv the team from the cdc found this does complicate vaccine development but we are moving very swiftly to develop vaccines against this new group of viruses says dr nancy cox chief of the cdcs influenza branch the hn strain of bird flu has spread across europe africa and parts of asia and killed nearly people worldwide and infected about since it reemerged in although it is difficult to catch bird flu people can become infected if they come into close contact with infected birds scientists fear the virus could mutate into a form that could pass easily between humans triggering a pandemic in which millions could die transmission from human to human all influenza viruses mutate easily and hn appears to be no exception but cox says the evolution of a second clade does not move the virus closer to humantohuman transmission like the group one or clade one viruses the group two or clade two viruses are not easily transmitted from person to person she says it really doesnt take us closer to a pandemic it simply makes preparing for the pandemic a bit more difficult the us department of health and human services has already recognised the two strains and approved the development of a second hn vaccine based on the second clade several companies are working on hn vaccines experimentally although current formulations are not expected to protect very well if at all against any pandemic strain a vaccine against a pandemic flu strain would have to be formulated using the actual virus passing from person to person partial protection researchers say while vaccines were needed against different strains of the virus a vaccination against one clade could provide partial protection against another we would expect the priming of a patient with a clade one vaccine could potentially reduce the severity of disease cox says for their study garten and colleagues analysed more than hn virus samples taken from both infected birds and people from through the northern hemisphere summer of garten says the bird flu strains being detected in europe are generally clade two strains the northern queensland town of innisfail copped the full force of cyclone larry when tropical cyclone larry lashed the queensland coast at the weekend it raised questions of whether it was a sign of a changing climate could it be the harbinger of a new droughtbusting la nintildea weather cycle could it be a product of humaninduced climate change or is it just too soon to tell larry slammed into australias northeast coast on sunday morning local time initial reports said it was the most powerful cyclone to hit the continent in decades moving at unusual speed and packing winds of up to kilometres an hour dr geoff love director of meteorology at the bureau of meteorology bom says larry was on a par with cyclone tracey which devastated darwin in the bom categorises cyclones from to with being the most severe love says larry was probably high category probably not quite and neither unusual nor unexpected larry was no different from any other tropical cyclone he says but love says more cyclones hit tropical queensland in la nintildea conditions a possible sign that australia is headed for a change after emerging from el nintildeo three years ago with an el nintildeo cyclones tend to form out closer to the dateline and probably occur before they reach australian longitude in la nintildea they form closer to the australian coast he says pacific oscillations records going back to the s show a clear la nintildeael nintildeo cycle love says the la nintildea and el nintildeo effects are two extremes of an atmospheric and oceanic oscillation in the pacific ocean they have a direct and significant impact on climate in some parts of the world including australia el nintildeo occurs when the surface of the ocean warms and leads to drier conditions in australia which mean more droughts and fires cooling surface waters cause la nintildea which causes wetter conditions and more flooding the two phases switch every few years but they dont always neatly alternate making it difficult to make predictions love says there have been about el nintildeos and la nintildea s in the past years this amounts to about six year cycles made up of roughly four neutral years and two years of el nintildeo or la nintildea or one year of each australia is currently in what love calls a neutral weak wishywashy period although there are signs were trending towards la nintildea i think we have been sort of just on the borderline he says the americans have a lower threshold theyre calling it a weak la nintildea were saying its just short of being a la nintildea what about climate change the latest global tropical cyclone season which is just coming to an end has been described as one of the worst in recent times making it tempting to view cyclone larry as a product of humanrelated climate change grant beard a climatologist with the boms national climate centre says the recent increase in intense tropical cyclones may be linked to warming looking at the globe it seems that the number of intense tropical cyclones has increased over the last years he says thats linked probably to the rising ocean temperatures and this is one sign of the enhanced greenhouse effect dr kevin walsh is associate professor of meteorology at the university of melbourne and previously worked on the effect of climate change on tropical cyclones at csiro he says climate change is likely to have some impact on cyclones although this is yet to be proved all the projections say sea temperatures are warming and there are well known theoretical relationships between the warmth of the ocean and tropical cyclones he says but its controversial whether those effects have yet been detected love says only time will tell whether larry is the product of climate change the jurys out he says any one event by itself doesnt prove or disprove anything the artificial muscles work just like real ones converting chemical energy into mechanical energy artificial muscles have been made in the lab that are times stronger than the real thing a recent study shows two kinds of these superstrong artificial muscles can convert chemical energy into mechanical energy making them function like natural muscles the scientists say dr von howard ebron and colleagues from the nanotech institute at university of texas at dallas report their progress in the current issue of the journal science the artificial muscles could help usher in an entirely new breed of socalled fuelcell muscles the scientists say these receive chemical fuel such as hydrogen or methanol through a circulatory system convert it to mechanical energy and store any unused energy for later such muscles could be used to move robots and robotic exoskeletons or as part of structures on air and marine vehicles that morph into different shapes in the future the humanoid robot sitting next to you at the bar may be drinking alcohol in order to work the next day says professor ray baughman the research team leader and director of the nanotech institute one of the most successful kinds of artificial muscle consists of a stretchy material which does not conduct electricity sandwiched between two layers of material that do when an electric current is applied the plus and minus charges accumulate on opposite layers of the sandwich they are attracted to each other and squeeze down on the rubbery centre giving the muscle its flexing ability a cord or batteries normally supply the power but baughmans team created two kinds of artificial muscles charged by a chemical reaction eliminating the need for rangelimiting power cords and bulky shortlived batteries the approach is not without challenges but it could transform the way complex mechanical systems are built writes dr john madden an assistant professor at the university of british columbia in the same issue of the journal carbon nanotubes in the first approach the scientists coated a sheet made of pure carbon nanotubes with platinum nanoparticles they immersed the sheet into a solution of sulfuric acid a chemical reaction accelerated by the platinum catalyst converts each molecule of the hydrogen fuel to two protons and two electrons repulsion between the electrons causes the nanotubes to expand in the second approach the scientists used a special filament known as shapememory wire which can be trained to contract into a particular shape when heat is applied to it the team coated a straight memory wire with platinum nanoparticles and then exposed it to vapours from methanol mixed with air a chemical reaction occurred between the the alcohol and the oxygen in the air which produced heat and caused the wire to contract both types of muscles could be used in autonomous robots or as robotic armor worn by soldiers or astronauts to give them superhuman strength the scientists say baughman imagines that the technology could eventually use sugars in the human body as fuel and enzymes instead of platinum to work one important artificial muscle a heart female eastern whipbirds sing with a regional accent which biologists say may be related to coordinating reproductive activities female whipbirds in australia sing the same basic songs but with regional accents researchers show female birds in general rarely sing so this latest find itself is unusual but the find is doubly noteworthy because the scientists observed that the males of this species psophodes olivaceus sing with no accent whatsoever it is so intriguing to see both of these opposite patterns occurring within the same species says lead researcher daniel mennill a professor of behavioural ecology at the university of windsor in canada you wouldnt be shocked to visit one town and hear people speak with a twang and then visit another town and hear a drawl he says but can you imagine if in your travels you found that females sounded different in each town but males had the same brogue these whipbirds demonstrate such a pattern mennill and his colleague amy rogers from the university of melbourne measured eastern whipbird recordings from different populations along the east coast of australia for each of the birds they recorded they measured the songs number of syllables the length of the first syllable the highest and lowest frequency of the last syllable the time between these frequency extremes and other characteristics the vast majority of female recordings showed variations on each of these criteria but male songs were all virtually identical the researchers publish their findings in a recent issue of the journal of avian biology and post samples of the birdsong on their website cracking the whip in the wild the males and females sing duets males initiate the duet with a long whistle and an earsplitting whip crack females then respond with a sharp chew chew in my opinion the whip crack sound might be the most extraordinary note produced by any beast in the animal kingdom mennill says it involves a pure tone that ascends or descends extremely rapidly across a very broad frequency spectrum it is possible that this note is difficult to perform and that females may favour males who are capable of executing this difficult note effectively while males must sing their hearts out for females both males and females engage in their own samesex singing contests for these contests usually each bird will perch itself near its territory boundaries birds then sing back and forth trying to match the song sung by the opponent often the songs wind up overlapping interesting findings peter slater a professor of natural history at the university of st andrews in scotland agrees with the findings the real surprise here is the stereotypy repetitive sameness of the males in some other birds females appear to choose mates on the basis that they perform a song that is quite hard to produce i like the idea that the whip crack may be such a phenomenon and this might explain its very unusual stereotypy slater says in terms of accents he says that geographical variations or dialects are found in other songbirds whales seals and primates mennill suggests that females may benefit by sharing songs that are similar to those of nearby females while these benefits remain unclear it is possible that the singing helps to somehow coordinate reproductive activities male eastern whipbirds perhaps might have evolved accents too if it were not for their impressive whip crack song with its stunning finale the technique may oneday be used to search earthquake rubble for survivors the researchers say a laserlike beam of light shone at a unique solid makes the material appear to disappear according to a new study the effect reported in a recent issue of the journal nature materials occurs at infrared light wavelengths so it cant be seen with the human eye but if it worked in the visible light with molecules that make up your hand when the laser hit your hand your hand would go transparent says team member professor chris phillips a physicist at imperial college london and then if you turned the laser up a little more the scene youd see through your hand would become brighter as the effect amplifies light in the beam he says phillips and his colleagues from the university of neuchacirctel switzerland think the method could one day work in visible light and lead to new technologies that help see through rubble to search for victims at a disaster site or observe internal body parts obscured by bone the scientists accomplished their feat with materials used to make semiconductor chips normally electrons that make up atoms in these materials interact with light beams in a benign way but phillips and his team reengineered the material to contain artificial atoms specially patterned crystals a few billionths of a metre long because the atoms are artificial the scientists could adjust the activity of the electrons which have wavelike characteristics when the light beam was shone onto the material it influenced the wavelike patterns of the electrons inside the artificial atoms so that they cancelled each other out and created a new transparent material that was half matter and half light the scientists went on to amplify the light beam even though of the artificial atoms stayed in a state of socalled low excitation this contradicts a theory posed by albert einstein that says in order to amplify the light in a laser beam the majority of the atoms must be in state of high excitation they have shown this can now be implemented in a solidstate medium which could be very important for more practical applications says lene vestergaard hau professor of applied physics at harvard university in the future the researchers aim to become better at controlling and amplifying the light beam so that they may not need a specially patterned structure to make the seethrough effect work the launch scramjet technology could oneday be used in planes that fly from london to sydney in two hours say the researchers a new scramjet engine shaped like a bullet will be tested in the australian desert tomorrow by an international team of scientists that hopes it will be more efficient than previous designs australian researchers from the hyshot flight program at the university of queensland will test the new scramjet developed by a british defence technology company qinetiq the experiment is to be carried out on australian defence property at woomera in south australia this friday local time and is also sponsored by the us air force and the canadian air force a scramjet supersonic combustion ramjet operates at speeds greater than mach or five times the speed of sound it is able to deliver a sustained thrust at hypersonic speed by rapidly sucking in oxygen and burning hydrogen fuel releasing steam as exhaust the hyshot team carried out the worlds first successful scramjet test flight at woomera in with a university of queenslanddesigned engine that original design had a twodimensional wedgeshaped air intake and a rectangularshaped combustor says associate professor michael smart who designs scramjets with the hyshot team he says the new scramjet has a threedimensional bulletshaped intake with an elliptical shaped combustor and the shape of the engine affects how efficiently air is scooped up its a ram effect and there are lots of different shapes you can use to try to push that air down through the engine so were just trying out different ones he told abc science online by phone from the woomera test site the hn bird flu virus doesnt lock onto the right receptors in humans says new research virologists say they understand why bird flu in its present form does not spread among humans the finding suggests the world may have a precious breathing space to prepare for any flu pandemic the reason lies in minute differences to cells located in the top and bottom of the airways the team reports in todays issue of the journal nature to penetrate a cell the spikes that stud an influenza virus have to be able to bind to the cellular surface the virus spike is like a key and the cells docking point called a receptor is like a lock they both have to be the right shape for the connection to happen scientists in the us and japan led by professor yoshihiro kawaoka of the university of wisconsin at madison found that avian influenza viruses and human influenza viruses home in on slightly different receptors the receptor preferred by human flu is more prevalent in cells in the mucous lining of the nose and sinus as well as the throat trachea and bronchi but the receptor preferred by bird flu tends to be found among cells deep in the lung in balllike structures called the alveoli it means hn is likely to hole up in a part of the airways that does not cause coughing and sneezing the means by which the flu virus is classically transmitted among humans birds infecting humans bird flu is lethal to poultry and dangerous for humans in close proximity to infected fowl it has claimed more than lives according to the world health organization but apart from a few anecdotal cases the mortality has occurred exclusively by direct transmission from birds to humans and not among humans themselves to acquire that contagiousness would open the way to a pandemic our findings indicate that hn virus can replicate efficiently only in cells in the lower region of the respiratory tract where the avian virus receptor is prevalent the paper says this restriction may contribute to the inefficient humantohuman transmission of hn viruses seen to date so what would turn hn into a pandemic virus first and foremost it would need mutations in the spike the haemagglutinin molecule to enable the virus to bind to cells in the upper respiratory tract this would enable the virus to spread via coughs and sneezes and nasal mucus which are caused by irritation to the upper airways to boost its pandemic potential the virus also needs changes in its pb gene which controls an enzyme essential for efficient reproduction nobody knows whether the virus will evolve into a pandemic strain but flu viruses constantly change says kawaoka certainly multiple mutations need to be accumulated for the hn to become a pandemic strain the findings suggest scientists and public health agencies may have more time to prepare for an eventual pandemic of avian influenza the team believes kawaokas team exposed various tissues from the human respiratory tract to a range of viruses in lab dishes the viruses were the human strains hn and hn and the bird strains hn and hn in addition there were two hn samples one taken from a human victim in hong kong and one from a duck in vietnam flu viruses reproduce sloppily which induces slight changes in their genetic code this movement is called antigenic drift and explains why seasonal flu viruses keep changing and new updated vaccines are needed but they can also make big changes called antigenic shift in which new genes are brought in thus creating a new pathogen against which no one has immunity a novel flu virus that emerged after world war i killed as many as million people by closely monitoring viruses from people infected with avian flu scientists can get a early warning as to whether these strains are mutating into forms that will make it easier to fit into human receptors kawaoka says the headaches colds and sniffles associated with sick building syndrome are more likely a sign of poor work satisfaction a new study shows socalled sick building syndrome does not exist according to a uk study that suggests its coldlike symptoms can be mainly pinned to job stress dissatisfaction and poor office relationships dr mai stafford of university college london and colleagues publish their findings today in the journal occupational and environmental medicine the research is part of the prestigious whitehall study a wider body of work looking at the health of public servants sick building syndrome is a popular yet vague term to describe headaches coughs tired or itchy eyes runny noses or inexplicable tiredness that are usually blamed on poor air quality in the office more than uk public servants aged and working in different buildings across london were questioned about their health they were asked to list any symptoms of sick building syndrome the physical properties of their offices and the demands of their job including levels of support at work separately the buildings were also assessed by independent field workers they checked temperature lighting intensity levels of airborne bacteria fungi and dust humidity ventilation flow noise level and concentrations of co and airborne organic chemicals one in seven of the men and nearly one in five of the women respondents reported five or more symptoms of the syndrome hot dry and dusty there was some evidence but minor that those who reported high levels of the symptoms worked in offices that were too hot and dry and had relatively high levels of airborne germs and dust but those with only low levels of the symptoms worked in buildings where there was poor air circulation and unacceptably high levels of co noise fungus and airborne chemicals in fact the biggest factors linked with the symptoms were job stress and lack of support in the workplace sick building syndrome may be wrongly named say the authors raised symptom reporting appears to be due less to poor physical conditions than to a working environment characterised by poor psychosocial conditions a long line of research previously research has highlighted a link between ill health and control over work job demands work overload and job category if sick building syndrome may not exist its symptoms do and they cost companies dearly in lost production the paper says it says the lesson for bosses is that when such symptoms come to light they should consider causes that go beyond the offices physical design and operation and delve into more complex areas such as job roles and the autonomy of the workforce dissolving co deep in the oceans needs to be considered says a german expert who is calling for more research pumping carbon dioxide into the oceans may be one way to help save us from global warming says a chemical engineer who admits the subject is taboo professor wolfgang arlt who has been visiting australias swinburne university of technology in melbourne says governments see this socalled ocean sequestration as too politically risky compared to geosequestration when co emissions are buried underground since ocean sequestration was first proposed years ago arlt says it has been the subject of relatively little research and he is calling for more i want to have every option equally researched he says emphasising that reduction of co emissions is the first priority before any form of sequestration alrt who is based at the university of erlangennuremburg in germany stresses he is not supporting ocean sequestration only its investigation as an option to help stop global warming arlts speciality includes the science of separating different chemicals such as co and air and he calls ocean sequestration the natural option nature does it already he says if you look at our total emissions of carbon dioxide one part is stored in the air and the other part is dissolved in the ocean the oceans are earths main buffer system he says he says increased concentration of co in the atmosphere has led to increased amounts of the gas dissolved in the surface of the ocean and this in turn has led to an increase in ocean acidity that is harmful to marine life going deeper but says arlt his initial calculations suggest ocean sequestration does not have to significantly increase the acidity of the oceans as long as the co is injected deep into the ocean and is mixed across the whole planet arlt says co can be injected into downwelling areas of the ocean and in its dissolved form will tend to stay at the bottom of the ocean where it can then be mixed by deep ocean currents across the planet he says one modelling exercise suggests co injected near europe will be distributed as far as australia in years time arlt says he predicts that the effect on ocean acidity using this method would be so small it would be unmeasurable and would not affect sea life on the ocean bottom but he thinks this should be investigated further he says another option is to neutralise the co before sequestering it in the oceans by mixing it with alkaline minerals such as limestone ipcc warns on ocean acidification a recent report on co capture and storage from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc canvasses options for ocean sequestration but does not include arlts argument the report says ocean sequestration could help lock up co for hundreds of years with deeper injection being more effective than shallower injection but it warns increased acidity at the ocean surface can harm marine organisms the report does not mention arlts point about downwelling waters and deep ocean currents alrt says the ipcc had wanted him to coauthor the report but because of time problems he did not contribute so my ideas are not inside the report he says the ipcc report notes that the effect of increased co in the deep ocean has yet to be studied whole range of options an australian coauthor of the ipcc report dr peter cook chief executive of the cooperative research centre for greenhouse gas technologies agrees little is known about ocean sequestration and more research is always good were going to need the whole range of options for decreasing co emissions he says but he says the ipcc took a very cautious view about the future of ocean sequestration we have to be very careful about doing it before we have a great deal more information cook says drainage from the southernmost dome of greenland polar ice sheets are melting faster than expected and could push sea levels up as much as metres by scientists warn in two studies released today based on current warming trends they say average temperatures could jump at least degc by the end of the century resembling the last great global warming surge years ago when seas rose as much professor jonathan overpeck of the university of arizona and dr bette ottobliesner of the national center for atmospheric research cowrote both studies which appear in the latest issue of the journal science they used a computer model for future climate predictions and ice sheet simulations to create a picture of the earths climate years ago they also used climateindicative data from sediments fossils and ice cores they conclude that the melting of ice sheets in greenland and in the antarctic today resembles what happened back then and that the risk of a comparable rise in sea level is high although the focus of our work is polar the implications are global these ice sheets melted before and sea levels rose the warmth needed isnt that much above present conditions ottobliesner says dynamic maps of the projected results of the rise in sea levels are available on overpecks website call for action overpeck says we need to act soon we need to start serious measures to reduce greenhouse gases within the next decade if we dont do something soon were committed to metres of sea level rise in the future he says a conservative estimate would call for sea level rises of metre per century he says he cautioned however that this estimate assumes the earth will get only as hot as it did years ago when the ice sheets melted the earlier ice melt was concentrated in the northern hemisphere in the summer months and was due largely to changes in earths orbit he says the climate warming were in now is global and its yearround and its due to human influences on the climate system he says that will be more damaging to the ice sheets than the that warming we had years ago the ice sheets are already melting accelerated by relatively warm water that eats away at them says nasa glacier expert dr bob bindschadler its not really a debate any more about whether sea level is rising or not i think the debate has shifted to how rapidly is sea level rising he says the research behind the abel prize for maths explains how violin strings vibrate the worlds most prestigious maths prize has been awarded to a swedish researcher for his work on wave patterns professor lennart carleson of the royal institute of technology in sweden was awarded the abel prize for maths for his work on the fourier series this says that everything from the vibration of violin strings to the spread of heat through a metal bar can be viewed as sums of simple wave patterns oscillating sine and cosine waves this led to the branch of maths known as harmonic analysis he also solved the socalled corona problem which looks at structures that show up around a disc when the disc itself is hidden an example might be the corona of the sun seen during an eclipse when its hidden by the moon the prize which is awarded by the norwegian academy of science and letters is often described as the nobel prize for maths the prize rules say it should aim to spur interest in mathematics among children and young people so far all winners of the prize have been in their s this pattern of spirals was made using a computer that analysed someones voice an australian digital artist is using his voice to design textiles pierre proske has developed computer software that translates different frequencies in someones voice into spiral patterns producing what he calls voiceprints proske developed the software while doing his masters in art and technology at swedens it university of gteborg hes used the software to design a pattern inspired by elements of japanese textiles a design that appeals to him because of its simple repeated elements computer code is very simple and minimalistic you have these ones and zeros so i thought it would be good to choose a very minimalistic textile as well the textile is made up of repeated spirals of more or less the same size in a particular dense and fairly regular arrangement see image below proske then scanned one of the spirals into his computer as the basic element in his voiceprint design next he used the software to analyse the frequency profile of a short sample of a voice you might get a bunch of low frequencies and some high frequencies depending on what you say and how you say it he says the software translates the relative amounts of different frequencies of a particular sound into a particular layout of spirals of different sizes different voice sounds can create different layouts of the spirals says proske he says the software could be used to generate patterns for textile and graphic design the idea is that it is actually meant to be quite accessible anybody could use their voice to generate these patterns proske sees his research as a modern take on old technologies im kind of inspired by the connection of textiles and computers because they have a historical link that goes back to the automation of the loom in the s he says proske says the same punched cardboard cards used to code for textile patterns were later used to program the first computers chocolate may give you shortterm pleasure if you crave it but its not an antidepressant as many people think chocoholics can happily eat chocolate for pleasure but for those who are stressed and clinically depressed the high is shortlived and chocolate may even deepen the downer a review shows the findings which will be published in the journal of affective disorders fly in the face of the myth that chocolate is an antidepressant the analysis which is the most comprehensive literature review on how chocolate affects mood shows that the motivation behind eating chocolate determines which neurotransmitters are activated and hence your mood the reviews australian authors from the black dog institute at the prince of wales hospital in sydney identified two groups of chocolate eaters based on motivation they identified the cravers who eat chocolate as an indulgent pleasure and the emotional eaters who use chocolate in a bid to alleviate depression professor gordon parker executive director of the black dog institute and lead author says cravers see chocolate like a good glass of wine and anticipating and eating the treat releases feel good neurotransmitters chocolate craving as an indulgent pleasure seems to stimulate the dopamine system in the brain and provides an enjoyable experience he says but the emotional eaters people who eat chocolate to relieve boredom stress or clinical depression are looking for an opioid effect to improve their mood for them at best chocolate only provides temporary relief he says but this is quickly followed by a return to or a worsening of their earlier negative state consuming sweet foods is thought to release the neurotransmitter betaendorphin in the hypothalamus which is said to have an opiate effect on the body but why the chocolate high is so transient and insufficient to sustain mood in those who eat it for emotional reasons remains unknown busting the myth the theory that chocolate acts as an antidepressant comes from the common belief that a serotonin deficiency causes chocolate cravings but the review found no support for this hypothesis it is true that chocolate acts on the same neurological system as serotonin but youd have to eat a truck load of chocolate before you have had the equivalent of one antidepressant tablet parker says our review rejects any possibility that chocolate desired as a way of relieving stress or when feeling down has any antidepressant benefit stimulants such as caffeine theobromine tyramine and phenylethylamine are also present in concentrations too low to have any significant psychoactive effect the review says for more information about depression including fact sheets support and referrals see the websites for beyondblue australias national depression initiative and depressionet if this research applies to humans scientists might have another source of stem cells scientists have isolated spermproducing stem cells from adult mice that have similar properties to embryonic stem cells if the same type of cells in humans show similar qualities the german researchers believe the cells could be used in stem cell research this would remove the ethical dilemma associated with stem cells derived from human embryos these isolated spermatogonial stem cells respond to culture conditions and acquire embryonic stem cell properties say professor gerd hasenfuss and his colleagues from the georgaugustuniversity of goumlttingen online in the journal nature stem cells are master cells that have the potential to develop into any cell type in the body and some scientists believe they could act as a type of repair system to provide new therapies for illnesses ranging from diabetes to parkinsons but their use is controversial because some scientits say the most promising stem cells for treating human disease are derived from very early human embryos left over from fertility treatments in the report hasenfuss and his team describe how they isolated the spermproducing stem cells from mice testes the cells which they call multipotent adult germline stem cells under certain conditions act like embryonic stem cells when the researchers injected the cells into early embryos they found the cells contributed to the development of different organs intruiging but more work needed professor chris higgins the director of the uks medical research council clinical sciences centre says the possibility of using the cells as an alternative to embryonic stem cells for therapy is intriguing however much more research is required before the similarities and differences between these testes cells and embryonic stem cells are understood and before their potential for use in therapy can be properly assessed he says dr stephen minger a stem cell biologist at kings college london describes the findings as pretty amazing but says more research is needed we would need to replicate this in humans just because it works in a mouse doesnt necessarily mean it will also work in people he says chatting on a mobile phone before sleep affects the electrical activity of your brain radiation from mobile phones stimulates brain activity in the early stages of sleep even after youve finished using the phone an australian study shows associate professor andrew wood from the brain sciences institute at melbournes swinburne university says his study also found that exposure to electromagnetic radiation from mobile phones can reduce levels of the hormone melatonin which is connected to the bodys sleepwake cycle but the study reported in the international journal of radiation biology says its premature to conclude that talking on your mobile phone before bed will get in the way of a good nights sleep alpha waves the studys participants received minutes of mobile phone radiation or minutes of sham radiation on successive sunday nights before being tucked into bed wood found that exposure to mobile phone radiation resulted in heightened alphawave activity in the brain alpha waves are associated with relaxation and daydreaming but normally disappear with sleep we found that in the first hour or so after getting to sleep that there was a significant change in one of the parameters of brain activity that is the amount of alpha waves in the brain wave patterns he says the increase occurred in the first nonrem period of the night when subjects had drifted off but before they were in deep sleep australian sleep specialist professor leon lack from flinders university in adelaide says this could be a sign that the first nonrem period of sleep isnt as efficient as it could be leaving people feeling tired when they wake up alpha waves are really only present when youre lying awake with your eyes closed trying to fall asleep he says if they are occurring during what would normally be sleep stages it could be the intrusion of some sort of wakeful brain activity at a time when it shouldnt be there melatonin researchers also tested participants urine for markers of the hormone melatonin which is produced in the evening and is associated with individual sleeping and waking rhythms wood says some participants had an increased amount of melatonin after exposure although there was no overall increase some people had significantly less of this melatonin marker in their urine before they went to bed but overall the amount of melatonin didnt change he says he says the difference was quite marked in some people indicating there may be a special subgroup of the population that are susceptible to the effects of mobile phone radiation lack says melatonins role in sleep is unclear and its uncertain whether having more or less affects your sleep wood says that at this stage mobile phones dont seem to influence how well you sleep unless the phones ring at all hours or youve had a particularly exciting conversation if people are finding they cant sleep after using mobile phones often its the content of what theyve been talking about thats the reason they cant sleep he says humpback whales have structured songs with phrases and themes but noone knows what they mean humpback whales sing songs that contain elements of human language according to a detailed new analysis of whale songs recorded in hawaii while researchers do not yet believe that whales have their own language per se they discovered striking similarities between human language and the songs of humpback whales megaptera novaeangliae lead researcher ryuji suzuki says that both humans and whales communicate by using discrete sound units that are arranged within a hierarchical structure for example a text consists of paragraphs a paragraph consists of sentences a sentence consists of clauses etc says suzuki at the massachusetts institute of technology they are at different levels of hierarchy or layers in terms of humpback songs a song session consists of songs a song consists of themes a theme consists of phrases a phrase consists of units put together all of these elements indicate that whales have something akin to their own syntax which normally refers to the grammatical arrangement of words within sentences the findings are published in this months journal of the acoustical society of america suzuki and colleagues designed a computer program that converted tiny sections of whale songs into mathematical symbols they then analysed the average amount of information that was conveyed for each symbol with a technique called information theory which quantifies complexity and structure information in the context of information theory does not include meaning but it focuses on how rare surprising predictable or complex a message is suzuki explains listening to whale song human observers who had no previous knowledge about whale song structure grouped humpback whale recordings into complexity redundancy and predictability the computer analysis and the human observers all found that whale songs are not only hierarchical they convey around one bit of information per second by comparison humans generate bits of information or variance for every word that is spoken each spoken vowel or syllable for example contains at least a few bits of data that correspond to different sounds produced by the speaker one versus may not sound very impressive but whales communicate in water often over long distances water helps to transmit songs because it carries sound four times faster than air using information theory jennifer miksisolds a research associate at the university of massachusetts at dartmouths school for marine science and technology is one of the few people in the world who is also using information theory to study whale songs i do agree with the new findings i am currently using information theory to analyse humpback whale communication and i have come to similar conclusions miksisolds says she agrees that marine mammal songs and sounds cannot be classified at present as language but both she and suzuki admit that they do not yet understand the meaning of whale songs and that more research is needed this is what we know so little about suzuki says humpback whale singers are always male and song is believed to be a mating display the song type evolves over the mating season and all animals in the same population seem to share the same song type that is humpback whales somehow copy each others song however the details of this are unknown what the songs mean is again unknown combining alcohol with an energy drink makes you feel sober enough to drive even though youre over the limit new research shows people who combine energy drinks with alcohol can feel more sober than they truly are a new study suggests brazilian researchers found that young men were no less impaired when they drank a mix of alcohol and a popular energy drink than when they downed a standard mixed drink but drinkers seemed to think they were less drunk according to research in the april issue of the journal alcoholism clinical experimental research the drinkers reported less fatigue fewer headache symptoms and better coordination this is concerning because people who mistakenly think they are less impaired can be a danger to themselves and others according to study coauthor dr maria lucia souzaformigoni i think people should be aware of this effect of the combination they feel better but they are not good enough to drive for instance says souzaformigoni an associate professor at the federal university of sao paulo energy drinks typically consist of carbohydrates b vitamins caffeine and taurine a derivative of an amino acid found in animal tissue some studies have shown that the beverages or their main ingredients may improve mood and physical performance and theres a popular though unproven belief that mixing energy drinks with alcohol can counter some of the effects of drinking this new study suggests that while energy drinks may help drinkers feel less tipsy they are still in fact drunk mixing your drinks the study included young men who each took part in three separate experiments one in which they drank vodka mixed with an energy drink another in which they had vodka mixed with fruit juice and a third where they drank only the energy drink in general the researchers found that the men reported fewer headache symptoms and less weakness with the energy drinkalcohol mixture compared with the standard mixed drink they also thought their handeye coordination was sharper but the men performed no better on objective tests of handeye coordination and reaction time to visual cues one of the dangers of this effect according to souzaformigoni and her colleagues is that drinkers especially young ones may feel free to drink more than they might otherwise have depressive effects on the brain its not clear souzaformigoni says why study participants feel less drunk when they had the energy drink even though they were still objectively impaired but in animal research she and her colleagues have found that some energy drinks ingredients mostly caffeine and taurine may counter some of the depressive effects alcohol has on the brain the findings in humans however suggest thats not enough to avoid becoming drunk astronomy physics biology architecture and inventing dr robert hooke tried them all seen here a page from his micrographia a study of biological specimens viewed through a microscope he made himself a manuscript charting the birth of modern science lost for more than years goes on sale this week the journal of dr robert hooke has been hailed as sciences missing link and has a price tag equivalent to about a million us million it contains details of experiments hooke conducted as curator at the uks royal society from and his correspondence as its secretary from the notes include a celebrated row between hooke and sir isaac newton over planetary motion and gravity and the lost record confirming the first observation of microbes by antoni van leeuwenhoek hooke was a keen observer of nature with a fascination for things mechanical but because of ill health as a child he was initially left largely to educate himself a talented artist he was sent to london when his father died to study under leading portrait painter peter lely he went on to study first at westminster school and then christ college oxford where he won a place as a chorister there he studied astronomy tried his hand at mechanical flight and rubbed shoulders with top scientists of the day a meeting of these scientists in november founded the society for the promoting of physicomathematical experimental learning which in mid received a royal charter and became the royal society of london biologist astronomer physicist in hooke finally found fame with publication of his micrographia containing pictures of objects he had studied through a microscope he had made himself and a number of biological discoveries diarist samuel pepys said of the book that it was the most ingenious he had ever read but his talents did not stop there hooke discovered that jupiter revolved on its own axis suggested that gravity could be measured using a pendulum architect inventor he was also a talented architect and was chief assistant to sir christopher wren in rebuilding london after the great fire of he also suggested the presence of gravitational vortices pulling comets from their orbit and invented the reflecting telescope the sextant the punchedpaper recordkeeper the wind gauge the worm gear and the wheel barometer but he fell out with newton when he accused him of stealing from his original ideas when he produced his theory of light and colour in and newton removed all reference to hooke from his famed principia hookes law despite hookes huge contribution to science and understanding the only innovation to bear his name is hookes law which says that the extension of a spring is proportional to the force applied hooke died in london in march aged experts from an auction house found his journal by chance in a cupboard at a private house in hampshire during a routine valuation researchers have developed a working interface between living tissue and silicon chips european researchers have glued live nerve cells onto a silicon chip and managed to get the neurones and chip to talk to each other the technology which used networks of rat neurones grown in culture could lead to the creation of neural prostheses or the creation of organic computers powered by living neurones the team says the italian german and swiss team says it took a lot of effort to develop a working interface between the living cells and the chips inorganic compounds we attacked the problems using two major strategies through the semiconductor technology and the biology says molecular biologist professor stefano vassanelli from the university of padua the team which is being funded by the european commissions information society technologies program put transistors and hundreds of capacitors on a millimetre square chip then the reserearchers used proteins found in the brain to glue the neurones to the chip vassanelli says the proteins also act as a link between the ion channels of the neurones and the semiconductors allowing neural signals to be passed to the chip in the opposite direction the chips capacitors stimulated the neurones causing them to fire vassanelli says the teams next project is to work out how chips could communicate with genes and vice versa genes are where memory comes from and without them you have no memory or computation he says we want to explore a way to use genes to control the neurochip keeping neurones alive professor ashley craig an australian neuroscientist with the university of technology sydney says linking computer circuits with brain cells can kill neurones by interfering with the brains fragile chemical and electrical balance and linking chips with genes may be an option commenting on the european proposal he says targeting genes instead would enable the chip to communicate with a network of cells genes contain the memory and knowledge of building things growth and regrowth he says they would target a particular gene maybe heart disease or addiction and link it to a computer chip tucked away under your skin and try and influence gene communication scientists have thought of using soil microbes to break down styrofoam into a useful byproduct bacteria that break down styrofoam into green byproducts could be used to make a new kind of biodegradable plastic new research suggests the method could help reduce the tonnes of petroleumbased plastic waste that makes its way into landfills each year says irish research leader dr kevin oconnor who heads the bioplastic research group at university college dublin oconnor and his teams research results will appear in the april issue of the journal environmental science and technology scientists have already used microorganisms to break down the kinds of chemical products found in styrofoam but noone has created a useful plastic byproduct says dr manfred zinn a research group leader at empa the materials science and technology lab of the swiss federal institute of technology to convert the plastics oconnors team used a strain of soil bacteria known as pseudomonas putida in nature this microorganism lives in the ground where it feeds on the carbon nitrogen hydrogen and oxygen found in organic matter such as dead plants styrofoam a material made from polystyrene contains hydrogen and carbon but not in a form that the bacteria can readily digest to make the plastic edible the scientists had to heat it under the process of pyrolysis which melted the polystyrene at very high temperatures in an oxygenfree environment to break the chemical bonds no oxygen means no burning and so no emissions during the process the polystyrene became liquid styrene a carbonbased compound that the bacteria can eat in the lab the scientists created a growing environment for the bacteria feeding them all their favourite foods including nitrogen and oxygen a steady flow of styrene oil supplied to the bacteria in a fermentor allowed the bacteria to proliferate after the colony grew to a healthy size the scientists stopped feeding the bacteria nitrogen that stimulated the bacteria to begin storing the carbon for use later storing carbon is the key it turns out that when the bacteria store the carbon they convert it into a plastic known as polyhydroxyalkanoate or pha pha is made up of fatty acids that are easily attacked by the bacterial enzymes pha is a biodegradable plastic that can be thrown on your compost heap bacteria in the compost heap use the plastic as food to grow so there is no damage to the environment you cant get greener than that for a plastic says oconnor the compound can also be harvested from the bacteria to make biodegradable plastic goods such as shampoo bottles credit cards and medical implants and devices all of which will fully degrade in the garbage says oconnor this is a great opportunity to make something better from a recycled material says zinn oconnor and team know that worldwide more than million tonnes of polystyrene are produced annually but are unsure how much investment it would take to build a plant capable of converting the material into pha but he says the process works on any petrochemical plastic waste and that fact could open up new areas of exploration for the petrochemical industry total solar eclipse as seen in it has been called the suneating dragon the spirit of the dead and the eye of god it has been a harbinger of great events good and evil famines bumper harvests wars and the birth and death of kings later today well know it as the total eclipse of the sun when the moon will be perfectly aligned with our star and the lunar shadow will alight on the tip of eastern brazil racing eastwards across the atlantic the umbra will reach the coast of ghana then head across togo benin nigeria niger chad libya where the eclipse will be at its longest lasting minutes seconds and then northwestern egypt it will then zip across the mediterranean passing between crete and cyprus before making landfall in turkey traversing georgia southern russia and then in kazakhstan the shadow briefly crosses russia again before expiring at sunset in mongolia after a marathon of hours minutes and kilometres around kilometres either side of this path of totality observers will get a partial eclipse for instance about a fifth of the sun will be obscured in the uk southern sweden and the southern gulf australia is among countries unable to see the eclipse but abc science online brings you photos videos and commentary of the event as seen from turkey see chasing the sun in turkey for more information far back in time eclipses are infrequent events and their rarity is enhanced by the fact that most take place over the ocean which covers twothirds of the worlds surface and so they go unwitnessed except by seafarers and remote islanders but writings dating back to the dawn of civilisation testify to thrill and dread as the sun the bringer of life was gradually blotted out the stars appeared in an indigo sky the terrified birds stopped singing and bats left their roost nothing can be surprising any more or impossible or miraculous now that zeus father of the olympians has made night out of noonday hiding the bright sunlight and fear has come upon mankind wrote the greek poet archilochus after an eclipse in bc after this men can believe anything expect anything dont any of you be surprised in future if land beasts change places with dolphins and go to live in their salty pastures and get to like the sounding waves of the sea more than the land while the dolphins prefer the mountains for the ancient chinese the eclipse was a suneating dragon which had to be scared away by the banging of cymbals and pans for the vikings it was caused by two chasing wolves skoll and hati hindu mythology blames a demon called rahu who spitefully takes a bite out of the sun from time to time even today in some cultures eclipses are believed to bring poisonous vapours and so food and water containers are turned upsidedown in protection watching and waiting the mostobserved solar eclipse took place in when the path of totality crossed major population centres in europe the middle east and asia this year no big city lies directly on the kilometrewide path although several including ankara lagos and tbilisi lie very close to it and will get a neartotal eclipse the luckiest of all are people who inhabit the mountains of central turkey says nasas veteran eclipse specialist dr fred espenak a quarter million people in sivas have the opportunity of witnessing a second total eclipse from their homes in less than seven years he says in clever kids the brains cortex or outer mantle thickens rapidly during adolescence intelligence may have more to do with how the brain develops during adolescence than its overall size researchers say us scientists at the national institutes of health show that the brains of children with high iqs show a distinct pattern of development the cortex or outer mantle of the brain starts out thinner and thickens more rapidly in very intelligent children it peaks around or years old before thinning rapidly in the late teens we found that the cortex showed a different pattern of development says dr philip shaw lead author of the research published today in the journal nature youngsters with average iqs have a thicker cortex to start with and peak earlier before gradual thinning begins shaw adds that the changes are subtle and what is driving them is a mystery why children have a thicker or thinner cortex initially is also not known brainy children are not cleverer solely by virtue of having more or less grey matter at any one age says dr judith rapoport a coauthor of the study rather iq is related to the dynamics of cortex maturation the scientists took magnetic resonance imaging scans of healthy children and teenagers aged every two years as they grew up they compared the scans to see how they related to the childrens iq very intelligent youngsters had scores of while high iqs were between and average between the smartest youngsters showed the highest rate of change in the scans the scientists believe the longer thickening time in the very brainy children might indicate a longer period for the development of highlevel cognitive circuits in the brain the researchers add that the thinning phase could involve a use it or lose it pruning or killing off of brain cells and their connections as the brain matures and becomes more efficient that might be happening more efficiently in the most intelligent children says shaw people with very agile minds tend to have a very agile cortex astronomers have found midsized moonlets embedded in saturns rings but that doesnt fit with current models of how the rings formed minute moons just a hundred metres or so across orbit saturn within its rings astronomers report a finding that questions how the planets majestic ring system came into being researchers report their findings today in the journal nature the prevailing theory is that saturns rings reflected by the distant sun comprise the remnants of an icy moon that long ago was smashed open by an asteroid or comet but a collision of this kind normally gives rise to debris in a wide range of sizes from big lumps a kilometre wide to pebbles a few centimetres across photographs and radar sensing by scout probes though have until now shown saturns ring particles to be remarkably small between a few centimetres to a few metres across the only big exceptions were a pair of kilometrewide moons called pan and daphnis that lurk within the ring system there seemed to be nothing in the intermediate size the missing rocks astronomers led by dr matthew tiscareno of cornell university new york believe they have found some of the missing mediumsized rocks their evidence comes from data sent back by the orbiting us spacecraft cassini which shows gaps shaped rather like a propeller blade or an elongated teardrop in some of the rings tiscarenos team deduct that the gaps are caused by what they call embedded moonlets these are rocks about metres across that were too small to be seen in the cassini pictures but which must have briefly scattered the particles as they orbited rather like a ship forms a bow wave and trails a wake that then closes behind it four of the teardrop gaps have been spotted so far and more may emerge later this year when cassini returns to the ring system to view it from a different angle the finding is the latest evidence to suggest that saturns seven rings first spotted by galileo in according to legend are a dynamic continuous evolving structure the debris becomes clustered gets torn apart by collision and is then reassembled by saturns gravitational forces and the particles own gravitational attraction research presented last year found that the outermost a ring has many empty spaces and part of the innermost d ring has become dimmer and moved closer to saturn by about kilometres since it was observed by the us probe voyager in and much is at stake under the new research funding plan both for the older established universities and the new ones a proposed plan requiring australian universities to prove their impact on business and the community before they get government research funding has met with a mixed response and curiously universities that focus on applied research are worried they could lose out under the proposed plan federal science and education minister julie bishop this week released a report that recommends an overhaul of the way university research funding is allocated the final advice to government on the research quality framework rqf comes after two years of deliberation under the current metricsbased system the government allocates block funding to universities based on a formula the formula values such things as success in gaining competitive grants the number of students completing phds and the number of publications produced the new system would use expert panels to allocate funds based on a more detailed assessment of research quality and for the first time an assessment of the impact of the research on endusers of research go response the group of go universities welcome the idea of measuring impact but have some concerns while impact is very important and research should always be done with some outcomes in mind we shouldnt expect that every bit of research thats being done in our universities is able to predict the sorts of outcomes it will have says go executive director virginia walsh the large sandstone universities that make up the go have the largest output of highprofile international research collaboration and publications and receive the lions share of research funding under the current system the go says the new plan is modelled on a year old uk system that is about to be disbanded and replaced by a metricsbased system its ironic says walsh that we are looking at the possibility of emulating something that has now been replaced by something much closer to what weve currently got other universities nervous too outside the go are newer and generally smaller universities that tend to focus more on applied research while you might think a system that values impact might work in their favour such universities are nervous they could lose out under the new plan to the larger universities professor greg baxter of the new generation universities group for example says it will depend on how research impact is measured and weighted against research quality i think the potential for significant disadvantage for universities like us is clearly there because you can set up the rules and the metrics to advantage the group of should it be so desired says baxter who is pro vicechancellor of research at victoria university professor andris stelbovics of the innovative research universities australia group of universities is also worried about the relative weight that will be given to impact and quality we do pure basic research or research based purely on scholarship says stelbovics who is pro vicechancellor of research of murdoch university but we also have quite a few research teams that work in applied areas he says he is concerned about how a university research consultancy with local government to solve waste management problems would be valued under the new system his group also wants funding for agricultural problems such as wheat rust disease which is only of relevance to a small group of countries including australia to be valued equally in terms of impact with research of global significance timetable questions minister bishop has set up a new group headed by chief scientist dr jim peacock to advise on the implementation of the new plan once its finalised and accepted by the government but universities are concerned about the proposed timetable for implementation walsh thinks it will take at least another year to work out the details of the plan including a costbenefit analysis and the universities also want to make sure they are given money to implement the new system so their researchers are researching rather than filling out audit forms if they were to do it extremely well its probably too expensive says baxter and if they do it on the cheap it may not be any better than the system weve currently got dr jeffrey stilwell in the background with phd student chris consoli holding the theropod toe bone fossil they found on the chatham islands the first proof that landdwelling dinosaurs lived on remote islands in the south pacific has been unveiled by an australianbased researcher dr jeffrey stilwell a palaeontologist from melbournes monash university says he discovered the fossilised foot finger and spinal bones of carnivorous dinosaurs on the chatham islands about kilometres east of new zealand the discovery confirms the chathams were once connected to new zealand by a fingerlike extension stilwell says prior to our discoveries only a few isolated examples of dinosaur fossils had been found in the northern part of new zealand he says now weve found dinosaur remains almost kilometres east out in the middle of the south pacific he adds that his team has already uncovered more dinosaur fossils in the chathams than had been unearthed in new zealand over the past years while some dinosaur remains had been found along the antarctic peninsula and in south america this is the first such discovery in the southwest pacific and is possibly unique in the southern hemisphere he says the dinosaurs were on their own evolutionary path for probably million years since the separation of the chathamsnew zealand region some million years ago he says stilwell found the first fossils by accident when he visited the chatham islands in no one had even hypothesised that there were any fossils out that far he says with a grant from the national geographic society stilwell and associates returned to the archipelago to continue their research the first findings of which were published in the journal palaeogeography palaeoclimatology palaeoecology but he says a subsequent trip to the islands in february yielded a huge collection of new fossils which are still being analysed the storys going to get better he says new guidelines recommend chest compressions to every two breaths to improve blood flow to the heart and brain new advice on how best to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr suggests doubling the number of chest compressions australian emergency medicine experts say this should mean more sustained blood flow especially to the heart and brain the move which was announced recently by the australian resuscitation council is now in line with international consensus and best evidence say the experts the new protocol recommends chest compressions to every two breaths when resuscitating infants children or adults the pattern of two ventilations then compressions should continue to achieve a rate of compressions a minute says council chair and university of western australia lecturer in emergency medicine associate professor ian jacobs he hopes the one conversion rate for all basic life support rescue attempts and patients would be easier to remember and increase the likelihood people will at least try cpr the new protocol also recommends compressions be delivered faster and harder people should visualise the centre of the chest and compress there interruptions should be minimised a defibrillator attached urgently other ventilation avoided and says any attempt at resuscitation is better than no attempt kelli mitchener from the australian college of critical care nurses and a nurse at melbournes austin hospital says the new ratio means better blood flow by increasing the number of compressions it means there will be fewer pauses where blood circulation is not occurring hopefully improving the patients outcome she says the changes are based on a review of published evidence which found giving more compressions may help save more lives and a consensus developed by the international liaison committee on resuscitation published in the journals resuscitation and circulation there are cardiac arrests annually in australia due to a heart attack drowning or drug overdose for example but less than half receive cpr before an ambulance arrives and most who dont will die says jacobs the guidelines which are available online are for the public but include sections for doctors hospitals and ambulance officers st john ambulance begins teaching the new techniques in its first aid classes from april a new lubricant that forms polymers to protect engine wear also saves oil according to new research a new smart lubricant that forms a protective film when it meets two surfaces rubbing together means engines need less oil a chemical conference has heard this week using about grams of the lubricant saves more than grams of oil according to a presentation at the american chemical societys meeting this week in atlanta while its inventors do not believe the lubricant can replace standard motor oil in vehicles they say it may someday replace the oil used to test engines and mechanical systems additives developed from the same technology could also stave off wear improve engine performance and reduce pollutants its developers say the technology behind the new compounds is called tribopolymerisation by tribopolymerisation we mean the use of small molecules in a fluid such as an oil to reduce wear and damage of the sliding surfaces by forming thin polymer films which offer protection says us researcher professor michael furey from virginia tech who developed the process with czeslaw kajdas and colleagues at the radom technical university in poland it is a process of molecular design we do not add any polymers to the system nor do we coat surfaces with polymers instead our monomers are designed to form thin polymer films directly on the rubbing surfaces continuously and only where needed furey says the international team of scientists has been working on the project since but recent developments include a precise way of measuring what happens as the films form the discovery of new classes of compounds such as the engine lubricant and agreements with three organisations who hope to further develop and market the technology furey says that engines recently were treated with about grams of the smart composition all passed the runin tests successfully with no signs of damage he says in a subsequent series of tests in a different factory location engines were pretreated the same way all engines were in perfect condition after the runin tests the results were quite amazing smelly fumes he and his colleagues also say the technology could reduce the emission of smelly fumes from the use of diesel in trucks cars buses and equipment currently many countries such as sweden and us states like california have imposed limits on the sulfur content of diesel fuels since sulfur oxide is one of the stinkiest pollutants the catch is that the substitute lowsulfur fuels increase wear and tear on the fuel injector and fuel pump according to the researchers who say they have invented diesel fuel lubricity additives that work with lowsulfur fuels to reduce their damage on the engine dr jorn larsenbasse former director of the surface engineering and tribology program at the us national science foundation says the technology is innovative it works well with metal surfaces especially steel because molecules stick onto it easily the engine pretreatment application might very well be possible larsenbasse says the inventors hope to conduct further studies on how high surface temperatures and other engine factors affect the performance of the new compounds power poles damaged by cyclone larry which hit northern australia last month but cyclones can be a lot worse says one expert cyclones like larry are not as intense as we think says a cyclone risk engineer and if we dont get our forecasts right he says australia could be left unprepared for the worst dr bruce harper a queenslandbased consultant who has a long association with the bureau of meteorology says cyclone larry which hit the northern town of innisfail recently was not as powerful as people think he says while the bureau predicted the cyclone would hit land as a category cyclone with winds of around kilometres per hour the closest weather stations showed it was a lot weaker harper says a station at south johnstone kilometres from innisfail showed wind speeds of kilometres per hour and the maximum speeds recorded at the nearest offshore station were at flinders reef which measured kilometres per hour both these measurements fall within the definition of a category cyclone my estimation is that it was a low category says harper who also advises local and state governments on cyclone risk and insurers on estimated losses from cyclones it wasnt kilometres per hour and if it was there would be barely a house standing in parts of innisfail he says the community needs to know that cyclones can be a lot worse than this inaccuracy not significant gary foley of the bureau of meteorology in melbourne acknowledges the cyclone was weaker than predicted but he says when all the data is in the actual wind speed will probably be calculated to be just or kilometres per hour less than what was predicted so how does that translate to a person making a response before the storm hits do you put in a couple more nails in the roof or something while harper acknowledges the bureau helped people prepare for a severe cyclone and is keen to emphasise the agency does the best with the technology and resources it has he says a difference of kilometres per hour could have a huge impact on damage and he also thinks that even after final estimates are made the bureau will still be overestimating the strength of larry and he says such overestimates present broader problems higher and lower estimates harper says most predictions of cyclone intensities cant be accurately verified because there arent enough weather stations collecting data on how strong the winds really are when they hit land but he says cyclone risk engineers like himself use the closest weather station measurements along with the actual damage caused by cyclones to make their own estimates of the strengths of cyclones once they hit land this information is used to build models that help develop building authorities to specify standards for cycloneproof houses and the models help insurance companies work out how much money they need to keep aside for cyclone damage payouts harper says estimates by cyclone risk engineers are almost always lower than those provided by meteorological predictions and he is concerned that the more widely publicised overestimates from the bureau might lead to public complacency it could give people a false impression of cyclone impacts and downplay the importance of building cycloneresistant buildings he says uncertainties harper says one of the reasons why the bureau is overestimating the strength of cyclones is because there are huge uncertainties in their measurements he says the satellite technology they use to measure cloud temperature as a proxy for wind speed is outdated it doesnt take into consideration the fact that cyclones can change rapidly or the fact that the size of a cyclone can affect its intensity he says harper says the bureau should have more radar to measure actual wind speed and possibly fly aircraft through cyclones to collect data as occurs in the us and there should be many more weather stations around the country so predictions can be more easily verified and models adjusted accordingly the bureaus foley agrees that given the funds better technology and more weather stations would give more accurate predictions but doubts it would be worth the cost he appreciates engineers like harper would like more weather stations but says the bureau cant be expected to be all things to all people and given the uncertainty that exists they would rather err on the side of caution the chemical composition of the sun appears very different to what we assumed analysis of moon soil has revealed analysis of the first sample of lunar soil collected by neil armstrong has thrown into disarray what researchers believe about the sun an international team of scientists says dr trevor ireland from the australian national university and colleagues report in the journal nature today the results of a study of oxygen isotopes on the surface of soil grains returned to earth by the apollo mission it was hoped the study would provide clues about the chemical makeup of the sun and the protoplanetary soup that gave birth to our solar system in particular researchers hoped to find evidence for either of the two reigning theories about the suns composition according to one theory the sun has a similar oxygen composition to the planets the other theory suggests it has enriched levels of the isotope oxygen instead the study indicates that while the sun is dissimilar to bodies like the earth and meteorites it has lower levels of oxygen than expected this was a completely unexpected result for us ireland says our sun is not the sun that we thought it was the finding also suggests the sun somehow ended up with a different composition from the cloud of dust and gas that preceded it ireland says he says this is based on other small rocky bodies known as carbonate chondrites which are the oldest known things in the solar system and have up to times more oxygen than other oxygen isotopes solar winds ireland says while we cant get samples directly from the sun we can infer its composition by looking at lunar samples which are believed to reflect its composition this is because lunar soil contains oxygen isotopes implanted by solar winds carrying elements blown out from the sun but after using a caesium beam to erode the surface of the soil grains and measure the isotopes oxygen oxygen and oxygen the researchers discovered unexpectedly low levels of oxygen we found that the oxygen did not agree with either a planetary composition or the oxygen rich composition ireland says the oxygen isotopes are telling us that the mix of components in the sun is different to that in the planets particularly in regard to the amount of dust versus gas that comprises the sun versus the planets ireland says an analysis of oxygen from jupiters atmosphere comets and other bodies in the solar system could shed more light on the mystery vietnams fight against bird flu humans infected with bird flu appear to have more of the virus in their throat and nose than people with standard human influenza strains a conference is due to hear today the findings may help explain why avian influenza a hn has such a high death rate in humans more than mortality dr menno de jong head of the virology department at the university of oxfords clinical research unit at the hospital for tropical diseases in ho chi minh city studied patients with bird flu he found the virus is often associated with disseminated infection in blood and faeces and with higher levels of viral replication in the nasopharynx compared with contemporary vietnamese influenza cases high viral levels disseminated infection and an intense inflammatory response also seem associated with poor outcomes he is due to tell the australasian society for infectious diseases annual scientific meeting in wellington new zealand today our main findings are that influenza hn seems to be characterised by high virus levels in the respiratory tract evidence suggesting disseminated infection virus detection in blood and rectum and likely as a result of this an intense inflammatory response de jong says high levels of viral replication are likely to play a role in determining a patients outcome by direct effects of the virus or by the inflammatory response to the virus he says the reason for the high mortality probably is not high replication rates per se but high replication rates of an extremely virulent virus he says antiviral drugs should be started early to prevent as much inflammatory response as possible he says two of the people in his study developed resistance to the antiviral drug oseltamivir and died as reported in the new england journal of medicine last december resistance implies suboptimal suppression of replication and strategies to minimise it include ensuring adequate levels of the drug in the body by increasing the dose or giving it intravenously or combining it with other antiviral drugs he says de jong says aviantype cell receptors being mostly in the lower respiratory tract could explain why bird flu does not spread among humans as reported in the journal nature recently this may explain why viral load seems higher in the throat than nose and why all infected developed pneumonia he says cockroaches make decisions as a group new research shows cockroaches govern themselves in a very simple democracy where each insect has equal standing and group consultations precede decisions that affect the entire group indicates a new study the research determines that cockroach decisionmaking follows a predictable pattern that could explain group dynamics of other insects and animals such as ants spiders fish and even cows cockroaches are silent creatures save perhaps for the sound of them scurrying over a countertop they must therefore communicate without vocalising cockroaches use chemical and tactile communication with each other says dr joseacute halloy who coauthored the research in the current proceedings of the national academy of sciences they can also use vision says halloy a scientist in the department of social ecology at the free university of brussels in belgium when they encounter each other they recognise if they belong to the same colony thanks to their antennae that are nooses that is sophisticated olfactory organs that are very sensitive he says give me shelter halloy tested cockroach group behaviour by placing the insects in a dish that contained three shelters the test was to see how the cockroaches would divide themselves into the shelters after much consultation through antenna probing touching and more the cockroaches divided themselves up perfectly for example if insects were placed in a dish with three shelters each with a capacity for bugs roaches huddled together in the first shelter gathered in the second shelter and the third was left vacant when the researchers altered this setup so that it had three shelters with a capacity for more than insects all the cockroaches moved into the first house a delicate balance halloy and his colleagues found that a balance existed between cooperation and competition for resources cockroaches are gregarious insects that benefit from living in groups it increases their reproductive opportunities promotes sharing of resources like shelter or food prevents desiccation by aggregating more in dry environments etc he says so what we show is that these behavioural models allow them to optimise group size the models are so predictable that they could explain other insect and animal group behaviours such as how some fish and bugs divide themselves up so neatly into subgroups and how certain herding animals make simple decisions that do not involve leadership important research dr david sumpter a university of oxford zoologist says the new study is an excellent paper and important it looks both at the mechanisms underlying decisionmaking by animals and how those mechanisms produce a distribution of animals amongst resource sites that optimises their individual fitness he says much previous research has concentrated on either mechanisms or optimality at the expense of the other for cockroaches it seems cooperation comes naturally professor frederick short retrieving marked plants from australias great barrier reef seagrasses around the world are in decline according to a global study that says human impact is largely to blame but australias underwater forests in queensland have bucked the trend and are generally in good shape the researchers find seagrass beds are shallow water ecosystems like a forest on the ocean floor not only do they serve as protective nurseries for juvenile fish and shellfish and a habitat and feeding ground for many marine species they protect the coastline from currents and weatherrelated erosion since the university of new hampshires professor frederick short and colleagues have been running the global monitoring program seagrassnet this has involved monitoring seagrass health at sites in countries worldwide including australia in general the researchers found a decline in seagrass around the world while they have not ruled out globate climate change as a factor they believe human impact is mainly to blame for example at a state park in malaysia researchers discovered that seagrass decline was due to onshore logging this had increased the level of waterborne sediments thus decreasing light reaching the bottom where seagrasses grow when seagrass beds disappear the impact is major for example a disease outbreak in the s wiped out of eelgrass in the north atlantic as a result the scallop fishery in the midatlantic disappeared and never really recovered the scientists are also monitoring seagrass beds in thailand home to shellfish to see the effects of the tsunami healthy pockets rob coles principal scientist with queenslands department of primary industries and fisheries based at the northern fisheries centre cairns led the australian arm of the research he says the good news is that seagrass beds off green island kilometres east of cairns are very healthy and so are seagrasses he and his colleague monitor in sites across queensland as part of the seagrass watch initiative he puts that down to low population density good light clean water and comprehensive water management and conservation programs in fact there is no real loss of seagrass in the great barrier reef world heritage area that we really know about there have been temporary losses due to storm damage and weve had a big loss in hervey bay due to cyclone damage and declines in some areas of the whitsundays but generally its good he says but thats not to say there is no cause for concern because increasingly people are moving to the coast and that will eventually impact on shallow water seagrasses so we must remain vigilant all writing systems contain key shapes like t and x that are based on nature researchers say when you pick up a pen and write youre not simply scratching down a set of abstract marks but representing the trees mountains and horizons that surrounded your forebears according to new research the research which will be published in next months issue of the american naturalist looked at more than writing systems throughout history it concludes that all letters and symbols like trademarks share universal shapes and forms based on patterns found in nature these classes of human visual signs possess a similar signature in their configuration suggesting that there are underlying principles governing the shapes of human visual signs the team from the california institute of technology writes the researchers say their work provides evidence that we select our visual signs to match the contours of natural scenes this is because we have evolved to be good at visually processing these forms the researchers say and the shapes we use in writing are chosen for visual recognition at the cost of manual efficiency in other words we use the letters we do because they are easy to read although they mightnt be the most efficient shapes to write this is in contrast to shorthand where forms are selected for speed and efficiency of writing at the cost of speedy reading l t or x dr mia stephens from the university of south australia a lecturer in linguistics text language and society says the researchers reduced written languages to a set of basic shapes including t l and x theyve organised and categorised all the different shapes and looked at the frequency and distribution of the shapes and theres a pattern she says they say you can detect similarities of human writing systems and the shapes are topographical so you can stretch them and squeeze them and muck around with them but theyve still got basically the same number of links and junctions she says the researchers also provide three sets of natural scenes from tribal rural and urban surroundings to show how these forms are present in our surroundings but stephens says the premise of the article is too simplistic she questions the primary evolutionary impulse of looking at scenery and imagines what our forebears would have thought at the time we have to eat we have to run away from predators and weve evolved to do those things not just look at scenery as scenery stephens also says the nature of written language is likely to change in future leaving the theory obsolete this argument is about the past and the future of writing is going to be completely different because weve now got keyboards she says researchers have grown artificial bladders from patients own cells that seem to work when transplanted into the body but noone knows how safe the procedure is in the long term says one commentator custommade bladders grown from patients own cells have been successfully transplanted and work in some cases for years scientists report writing in the lancet journal they describe the cases of seven patients who had new bladders engineered from a plug of tissue grown from their own dysfunctional bladders we have shown that regenerative medicine techniques can be used to generate functional bladders that are durable says dr anthony atala of wake forest university in north carolina who led the research this suggests that regenerative medicine may one day be a solution to the shortage of donor organs for those needing transplants patients given transplants of bladders made from their own cells would not need to take drugs to prevent organ rejection as do patients given transplants from either living or dead donors atalas team worked with immature cells known as progenitor cells from the patients bladders the researchers have been working for years to find ways to first identify and separate these cells then to coax them into growing on a scaffold into the two main cell types found in bladders the patients were children and teens aged to who had poor bladder function because of a congenital birth defect that causes incomplete closure of the spine their bladders are too stiff and can cause pressure on the kidneys that eventually damages them such patients often get bladders reconstructed from the intestines but the procedure is imperfect atala a urinary surgeon and an expert in regenerative and stem cell science wanted to try to grow replacement bladders for the patients measuring for a match we do a threedimensional ct scan a computerised imaging analysis and we figure out what the bladder shape should look like atala says we then take a small biopsy of their bladder about half the size of a postage stamp the researchers then separate the muscle cells on the outside of the bladder and the specialised cells that line the baglike organ then they create an artificial scaffold on which to layer the cells the cells are grown in special compounds that nurture the progenitor cells and allow unwanted cells to die out the resulting cells are then layered onto the scaffold and incubated until they grow and spread it is very much like baking a layer cake atala says you are placing these cells on one layer at a time atala works with stem cells the bodys master cells but in this case his team made use of progenitor cells which are slightly further along the pathway from a blank slate master cell organ factory his team is also working to create blood vessels kidneys pancreases hearts livers and nerves the technology has been licensed from atalas former employer the childrens hospital in boston to a new company called tengion created to take advantage of atalas work the new bladder technology has not yet been approved by the us food and drug administration for widespread use in a commentary dr steve chung from the advanced urology institute of illinois describes the work as a milestone that could especially help people with cancer of the bladder which is overwhelmingly caused by smoking but he recommends putting the celebrations on hold until the technique has been tested by other teams and over longer periods to see whether it is safe as well as effective are your hormone levels going up just anticipating a good laugh is enough to increase the level of feelgood hormones in your blood a conference has heard previous work has shown that laughter triggers a cascade of beneficial physiological changes but researchers presenting a new study at the experimental biology conference in the us recently say theyve now shown that merely anticipating mirthful laughter before watching a funny video has significant neuroendocrine effects professor lee berk of loma linda university in california says people who were just about to watch their favourite funny video had more beta endorphins and more human growth hormone hgh than those who were told theyd be reading magazines for an hour we believe that results suggest that the anticipation of a laughter event initiates changes in neuroendocrine response prior to the onset of the event itself he says beta endorphins provide natural pain relief and low levels are associated with depression hgh is involved in growth development and cell maintenance and some research suggests it plays a role in maintaining a healthy immune system gags or mags berk describes these effects as the biology of hope and says they are linked to the anticipation of a positive mood state in the study people where asked to choose their favourite funny video they were told three days before the experiment whether they would get to watch their video or sit in a neutral room and thumb through a pile of magazines their blood hormone levels were tested just before the video was turned on four times during an hour of video watching or magazine reading and three times afterwards berk says the hormone levels stayed high throughout the video and afterwards anticipation can be powerful professor nicholas keks of monash university an australian researcher whose expertise includes hormones in psychiatry says anticipation is a powerful emotion in terms of triggering physiological and emotional responses anticipation is a huge issue in areas that affect our psychology whether it be anticipation of pleasurable activities or a bit of pain he says you just have to look at the classic example of salivation before food or expectation of sexual activity i think laughter belongs in that group he says the physiological changes shown in the study are probably linked to the socalled flight or fight response of nervous system arousal part of laughter is a general arousal and what that will do is stimulate various hormonal and autonomic systems which go along with arousal he says berk says he next wants to study cytokine and inflammatory immune responses to the anticipation of laughter astronomers found the methanol cloud in the woh region of the milky way where stars form astronomers say they have spotted a cloud of alcohol in space that measures billion kilometres across a finding that could shed light on how giant stars are formed from primordial gas the vast bridgeshaped cloud of methanol has been spotted in a region of the milky way called woh where stars form by the gravitational collapse of concentrations of gas and dust researchers led by dr lisa harveysmith spotted the cloud from the uks jodrell bank observatory they present their findings today at a meeting of the uks royal astronomical society in leicester the researchers have revealed giant filaments of gas by detecting masers these are like lasers but rather than emitting beams of light masers emit beams of microwave radiation which the molecules in the gas cloud amplify millions of times the largest of the maser filaments which were detected using the merlin radio telescope was billion kilometres long the researchers say the entire gas cloud seems to be rotating as a disc around a central star just like accretion discs in which planets form around young stars harveysmith says the discovery is surprising as until now researchers had thought of masers as pointlike objects or very small bright hotspots surrounded by fainter halos in astronomers spotted methanol for the first time in one of the disclike clusters that form around nascent stars that discovery opened up a new area of debate in astrophysics challenging the conventional view that interstellar chemistry could not provide the conditions for creating complex molecules until then researchers thought the molecules would be ripped apart by ultraviolet radiation from stars and other tough conditions around organic molecules have also been identified so far in space fuelling speculation that these complex molecules may have helped to sow the seeds for life on the fledgling earth the boxing day tsunami destroyed the forest that once grew along this indian coastline mangroves and coastal forests offer little or no protection against tsunamis says new research that debunks earlier findings last year researchers studied coastal villages in the tamil nadu region of india in the months after the boxing day tsunami they concluded that death rates were lower in villages fronted by mangroves but when researchers including those from the australian research councils centre of excellence for coral reef studies analysed the data they found a very different story the most important determinants of the number of people that died in the tamil nadu region were the distance of the village from the coast and its height above sea level says coauthor and australian marine ecologist dr andrew baird in effect there was no protective function of these coastal forests baird says while the hypothesis of the original research was reasonable it was not borne out by their findings published in the april issue of the journal estuarine and coastal shelf science their analysis revealed that the distance of a village from the coast and the height of the village above sea level explained of the variation in mortality among villages once these two variables were taken into account vegetation area seemed to account for less than of the variation mangroves and intact coastal ecosystems are wonderful and necessary things but they wont protect you from tsunamis baird says were concerned that by telling people that mangroves and coastal forest will protect them from a tsunami will give people a false sense of security when the next wave comes people may be misled into thinking that they are safe because their village is fronted by a mangrove forest the other concern is that the concept of green belts and buffer zones is being used as an excuse by the tourism industry and other interests such as plantation owners to move people away from their homes and livelihoods and take this land from them baird says people would be better to concentrate on earlywarning systems and effective evaluation strategies in the event of another tsunami thats the way youre going to save lives he says researchers from the university of guam and the wildlife conservation societyindonesia program were also involved in the new analysis will the venus express mission yield new insights into what awaits earth a space probe that arrives at venus today will yield new insights into what caused the runaway greenhouse effect there and could bring a salutary warning for our own planet scientists say the european space agencys venus express will spend three years peering through a shroud of toxic sulfur clouds to glean information about the climate atmosphere and curious backwards rotation of the socalled pressure cooker planet its also hoped the mission will help answer questions about what caused its mysterious resurfacing some million years ago and whether it is being shaken by seismic activity and volcanoes it may also provide clues about whether the earth and venus were once similar and when and why they took such radically different paths says dr frank mills of the australian national university an expert in the chemistry of the venusian atmosphere who has been working with scientists directly involved in the mission there are many uncertainties in trying to reconstruct venus evolution he says some of these may be resolvable by making appropriate observations the greenhouse effect the uks royal astronomical society says any astronaut unlucky enough to land on venus would be simultaneously crushed roasted choked and dissolved venus atmosphere is times denser than earths and is made up of the greenhouse gas co scientists say this causes a strong warming effect and heats the surface of the planet to around degc there are no signs of water on venus and its surface is apparently more arid that the driest desert on earth associate director of the australian centre for astrobiology at macquarie university dr jeremy bailey says isotope ratios in the atmosphere suggest that venus once had oceans that have since evaporated dr john lattanzio from australias centre for stellar and planetary astrophysics at monash university says that unlike earth venus lacks a co cycle on earth this cycle means the co gets locked into water and rock and comes back out through volcanic activity he says so at any given time on earth theres a lot of co thats out of the atmosphere and it selfregulates he says venus doesnt have a co cycle because there arent any oceans mills says the probe may also help explain whether the co on venus is produced by a catalytic reaction he says the probe will also shed more light on the general processes by which atmospheric greenhouses work venus atmospheric greenhouse has both similarities to and differences from earths he says and data from this mission will allow scientists to compare the two a mirror to our own future bailey says learning more about venus will help us understand where our own planet is headed but he doesnt believe anything like venus will result from the amount of co were currently putting into the atmosphere rather the earth may end up like venus over billions of years because of the increasing brightness of the sun in about a million years it will have increased by about and its estimated that will be enough to trigger the sorts of changes that have happened in venus he says mills says that venus teaches us not to take for granted that the climate on earth will always be benign and support life research on how venus may have evolved what its carbon cycle is like and how volcanic activity may influence climate helps in understanding what is possible for a planet he says nasas deep space network including the canberra deep space communication complex has been tracking venus express venus express is due to end its million kilometre five month journey around pm aest utc today for more information including updates and podcasts go to the esa venus express website unique conditions at the sea of galilee or lake kinneret as its also known may have caused a patch of ice to form near its western shore says an oceanographer the new testament says that jesus walked on water but a us professor says there could be a less miraculous explanation he walked on a floating piece of ice professor doron nof a professor of oceanography at florida state university says his study found an unusual combination of water and atmospheric conditions could have led to ice formation on the sea of galilee he and his coauthors describe the local freezing phenomenon as springs ice nof used palaeoceanographic records of the mediterranean seas surface temperatures and statistical models to examine the dynamics of the sea of galilee which israelis know now as lake kinneret the study published in the april issue of the journal of paleolimnology found that a period of cooler temperatures in the area between and years ago could have included the decades in which jesus lived a drop in temperature below freezing could have caused ice thick enough to support a human form on the surface of the freshwater lake near the western shore nof says this is an area where the researchers say many archaeological findings relating to jesus have been found it might have been nearly impossible for distant observers to see a piece of floating ice surrounded by water nof says he offers his study as a possible explanation for jesus walk on water if you ask me if i believe someone walked on water no i dont nof says maybe somebody walked on the ice i dont know i believe that something natural was there that explains it we leave to others the question of whether or not our research explains the biblical account nof says the chance of similar icy conditions in northern israel today is effectively zero or about once in more than years when nof offered his theory years ago that wind and sea conditions could explain the parting of the red sea nof says he received some hate mail even though he noted that the idea could support the biblical description of the event and as his theory of jesus walk on ice began to circulate he had more hate mail in his email inbox they asked me if im going to try next to explain the resurrection he says if you catch bird flu then shop at your local market the stallholder might need antiviral drugs as well as you giving antiviral drugs both as treatment to infected people and as prophylaxis to their close contacts provides the best chance of minimising the impact of a bird flu pandemic new research suggests the australian study found targeted prophylaxis would delay the onset of a pandemic buying time to hopefully develop and distribute a vaccine but a treatmentbased strategy would not significantly delay the onset of the disease or reduce the attack rate the federal governmentfunded study found the study by dr james mccaw and dr jodie mcvernon from the university of melbourne may be considered by health authorities if avian influenza a hn reaches australia mccaw a theoretical physicist and mcvernon a paediatrician and research fellow used a mathematical model to determine the optimal use of australias stockpile of million doses of antiviral drugs during a pandemic the model examines differences between using antivirals as treatment once a person has bird flu to reduce their chance of dying and of transmission and using drugs as postexposure prophylaxis for those who have come into contact with an infectious person the model says every time a new person becomes ill contacts need to be tracked down and given antivirals mccaw told the australasian society of infectious diseases annual scientific meeting in new zealand this week research indicates that on average the typical person will have close contacts with people over a few days being relatives friends and work colleagues and being others such as shopkeepers and the bus driver the researchers defined a close contact as someone who had a twoway conversation within a metre of an infected person mild or catastrophic authorities wont know whether a pandemic will be mild or catastrophic until it hits mccaw says the model indicates that if mild treatment of those infected will reduce the number of people who become ill and slow transmission and prophylaxis will delay the pandemic by several months buying time to develop a vaccine for a severe pandemic the model shows that treatment fails to reduce the overall number of people becoming sick it has benefits on an individual level by presumably reducing an individuals mortality but not at a population level mccaw says but prophylaxis continues to work by delaying exposure the federal department of health and ageing and the national health and medical research council have contributed to this research as part of pandemic preparedness planning many chickens have been culled to stop the spread of bird flu but experts say the next human flu pandemic is just as likely to come from elsewhere birds are not the only source of viruses that could become the next flu pandemic say two australian virus experts who argue the spanish flu virus came from mammals not birds as recently suggested and the researchers call for greater surveillance of flu viruses already in people or in other mammals such as pigs or cats dr mark gibbs of the australian national university and retired virologist professor adrian gibbs report their argument today in the journal nature theres a huge focus on birds and that is good but we need to extend the surveillance says mark gibbs in october last year a team led by dr jeffrey taubenberger of the armed forces institute of pathology in the us reported in nature that the spanish flu virus which killed millions around the world in was a bird virus that leapt the species barrier into humans the researchers said rna material from the virus obtained from preserved tissue of victims of the pandemic showed it was similar to bird viruses including the deadly hn strain that is of such concern today taubenberger and team also said their argument was supported by family trees constructed by comparing particular virus genes with equivalent genes from a broad range of viruses that have been found in other animals but gibbs disagrees with taubenbergers interpretation of his own virus family trees he says while it is true that the hn strain originated in birds in the distant past the question is when recombination in mammals taubenberger argues the virus came directly from birds without combining with viruses in other animals first but gibbs says the family trees show the virus evolved from a virus that had already been in mammals for some time he says the fact that you get a different family tree depending on the virus gene used to construct it supports the idea that the virus was a result of virus recombination in animals like pigs horses or cats gibbs also says the virus may have been in humans or years before the pandemic as suggested by studies showing some elderly people had immunity to the flu he suspects it is a coincidence that the and bird flu viruses taubenberger studied were so similar citing a phenomenon known as parallel evolution wings have evolved in insects birds mammals and reptiles he says but they havent evolved from a common ancestor with wings theyve evolved wings independently this happens in flu as well in fact its probably very common in flu but not well understood focus on birds gibbs says taubenbergers linking of bird flu and the pandemic increased alarm about bird flu but the notion that the threat from influenzas only comes from birds is actually quite wrong he says there is a reasonable chance that the next pandemic may come from an influenza virus which is already in people or in pigs or in some other mammal he says gibbs says it is important to know what really happened in the pandemic because it was one of the most serious disease outbreaks in history this fishy creature which was up to metres long walked on land with fins that have armlike bones fossils of a million year old species of ancient fish fill an evolutionary gap in the transition between water and land animals scientists say remains of the new species named tiktaalik roseae were found encased in frozen rock north of the arctic circle it has the fins and scales of a fish but its crocodilelike skull neck and ribs resemble those of a land animal it is a fish that shows a surprising combination of characteristics of landliving animals says professor neil shubin of the university of chicago whos team publishes its discovery in todays issue of the journal nature this animal represents the transition from water to land the part that includes ourselves he says the nearly complete and very wellpreserved specimens show the creature had sharp teeth a jaw from to centimetres across and a flattened body that could reach metres in length it shows us the stages by which landliving animals were constructed shubin says blizzards and bears the scientists battled freezing temperatures and blustery storms to get to the site on the remote ellesmere island more than kilometres north of the arctic circle in canada they also faced the threat of polar bears during their search for socalled elpistostegid fish which are thought to be most closely related to tetrapods land animals with limbs such as amphibians reptiles birds and humans previous fossils representing this evolutionary event have really been fish with a few land characteristics or land vertebrates with a few residual fish characteristics says dr andrew milner of the natural history museum in london these fossils show an animal that sits bang in the middle between the fish and land animals what is generating the most excitement are joints in the fishs pectoral fins which have bones that compare to the upper arm forearm and primitive parts of the hand of landliving animals most of the major joints of the fin are functional in this fish says shubin the shoulder elbow and even parts of the wrist are already there and working in ways similar to the earliest landliving animals the fossils also indicate that the transition from water to land occurred gradually in fish living in shallow water they gradually developed features to live on land over time once was balmy the sediment in which tiktaalik was found has been dated to around million years ago in the swampy primeval era known as the devonian at that time what is now frigid arctic canada had a balmy subtropical climate for it was part of a megacontinent that straddled the equator shubin believes that tiktaaliks size and shape indicates that it was fitted for living in small streams in a delta system an environment that probably encouraged the fish to venture into shallow water or even make forays onto land in search of food or shelter from predators the skeleton of tiktaalik indicates that it could support its body under the force of gravity whether in very shallow water or on land says coauthor professor farish jenkins of harvard university this represents a critical early phase in the evolution of all limbed animals including humans albeit a very ancient step in a commentary in nature evolutionary biologists professor per erik ahlberg of swedens uppsala university and dr jennifer clack of the university of cambridge hail the find as being quite literally groundbreaking the newlydiscovered species owes its name to the elders council of nunavut which was invited by the scientists to propose a formal name tiktaalik pronounced tictalick is the word in the inuktikuk language for a large shallowwater fish the test drug triggered a powerful immune response leaving six trial participants seriously ill but experts are still puzzled about what exactly happened and why animal studies gave no clue to this possible sideeffect an investigation into a uk drug trial that left six men seriously ill has found no evidence to suggest there was anything wrong with the drug or the way the tests were run a regulatory body says in an interim report the medicines healthcare products regulatory agency says the problem appears to be due to an unprecedented biological reaction to the drug in humans that had not been seen previously in animal tests our main conclusion is that there was a powerful pharmacological action of this drug in man which was not detectable in the preclinical studies done in the nonhuman primate species even in far higher doses says the agencys chief executive professor kent woods the drug had previously been tested on rabbits and monkeys as a consequence the agency will not authorise any trials for similar drugs without taking external expert advice this does not mean a standstill on such research but we feel that we need additional expert advice in certain areas relating to the authorisation of those studies woods says uk health secretary patricia hewitt also agreed to set up a group of international experts to examine the issue further trial by trial six men were left seriously ill at a hospital in north london on march after taking part in the clinical study to test the drug tgn designed to treat chronic inflammatory conditions and leukaemia of the six five have left hospital and one is making a good recovery in the days after the trial two of the men were described as critically ill with organ failure the trial was run by us drug research company parexel international corp on behalf of german company tegenero ag at the time parexel said it had operated within regulatory guidelines and tegenero said the response did not reflect the results obtained from initial laboratory studies monoclonal antibodies tgn belongs to a class of drugs known as monoclonal antibodies which specifically bind to target molecules tgn targets and activates an immune system protein called cd this is a complex scientific issue which raises important scientific and medical questions about the potential risks associated with this type of drug and how to make the transition from preclinical testing to trials in humans the report says the regulatory agency will now seek expert external advice for any future phase one trials when drugs are first tested on humans involving monoclonal antibodies or other novel molecules targeting the immune system woods says it is vital that they learn lessons from the trial which he describes as a wholly exceptional occurrence david webb professor of clinical pharmacology at the university of edinburgh says the reports findings could result in a change to the design of first phase trials for monoclonal antibodies one obvious difference might be to dose subjects sequentially rather than at the same time which at the very least would minimise the number of subjects put at risk he says a new form of silicon is said to be easier and cheaper to make than traditional silicon yet works just as well but will it be good enough for future generations of computer chips japanese researchers have made a liquid form of silicon they say might one day be sprayed onto chips with an inkjet printer a team led by masahiro furusawa of japans seiko epson corporation says the new form of silicon is easier and cheaper to make than conventional silicon yet works just as well the researchers report their work today in the journal nature the new form of silicon comprises cyclopentasiline a siliconbased polymer that comprises five silicon atoms joined in a ring and is liquid at room temperature ultraviolet light is used to break open the bonds of some of the rings and let the molecules reform into long placid chains that behave like viscous oil the mixture is then diluted with a solvent like toluene and is so fluid that it can be coated onto a surface by spinning or even sprayed by an inkjet printer the resultant liquid film is then baked at around degc to turn it into a hard mosaic of flat silicon crystals whose semiconductor qualities are as good as the ultrapure slabs made by conventional refining the researchers say in a review of the work in nature associate professor lisa rosenberg a canadian chemist at the university of victoria in british columbia says the new process has some drawbacks as it still has to rigorously exclude air and water but she says the ability to make silicon film by inkjet is a clear breakthrough it will not provide the resolution necessary to pattern a highdensity integrated circuit and therefore make a computer chip she says but what it will certainly allow is the remarkably straightforward generation of simple cheap and flexible circuits for displays as well as a range of other applications solar cells xray detections and multianalyte chemical sensor included has silicon had its chips analysts have long predicted the demise of silicon as a chip component due to the costs of purifying and processing it this usually entails taking highly purified natural silicon which occurs in the mineral silica and heating it in a vacuum to create a mist of free silicon atoms that then condenses onto a surface this refining requires conditions to be ultraclean as an intruding speck of dust or thimbleful of unwanted gas molecules can ruin the outcome the complexity and cost have led to research into alternatives to silicon the japanese teams method doesnt need high vacuums high temperatures or ultraclean environments its possible to create order by introducing disorder say researchers who have been working with computer models of swinging pendulums physicists have surprised their colleagues by turning chaos into order us physicists report how a network of interconnected pendulums can be made to swing in sync by being pushed at random times sebastian brandt and team at the washington university in st louis report their findings in the journal physical review letters the researchers constructed a computer model of an interconnected network of pendulums that swing out of sync when they are pushed at the same time but when the pendulums are pushed at random they swing in an ordered and synchronised way the researchers report the thing that is counterintuitive is that when you introduce disorder into the system when the forces on the pendulums act at random the chaos that was present before disappears and there is order says brandt the researchers say there is much to learn about the role of disorder in complex systems and suggest their work might be relevant to understanding synchronisation of neural activity in the central nervous system their model system and neurones are both nonlinear which means that there is no linear relationship between the amount of force applied and the response when you hear your favourite music twice as loud you dont double the pleasure says brandt explaining how one aspect of the brain hearing is nonlinear this is of course basic research he says but what you can learn from this is that complex systems sometimes behave in a very unexpected way completely opposite to your intuition or expectation surprising australian physicist professor joe wolfe of the university of new south wales says the findings are a surprise although not counterintuitive its not really counterintuitive because ones intuition doesnt really work for such systems because theyre complicated he says our intuition is good for dealing with simple things rather than complicated things wolfe also says the research only has limited applications because the researchers used calculations with specific numbers rather than solving equations made up of symbols such as x and y this means they do not have a solution that can be used to understand every possible case he says inspiring a new theory wolfe says ideally the findings would inspire someone to come up with a general theory to understand what was going on but he says it is very hard to find mathematical solutions to complicated nonlinear systems and he thinks the idea that the research could help understand neurones is drawing a long bow a system of neurones is also a system of nonlinear things that interact in a way that you dont understand and produce sometimes surprising results says wolfe i wouldnt say its terribly relevant its just an interesting observation penguins million years old are closely related to todays yelloweyed penguin new dna analysis suggests new analysis of the worlds oldest fossil penguins confirms some birds survived the mass extinction that killed the dinosaurs million years ago researchers say the penguins once lived in shallow seas off new zealands east coast million years ago now a molecular study published in the journal molecular biology and evolution links them closely to modern penguins coauthor associate professor ewan fordyce from the university of otago says penguins are specialised birds that evolved much later than other species the fact that they have been found within a few million years of the dinosaurs extinction is compelling evidence that modern birds must have evolved earlier and diversified during the time of the dinosaurs he says it also suggests that many of those bird lineages survived the catastrophe that wiped out the dinosaurs so its unlikely that there was a big turnover with modern birds only emerging after the mass extinction the study incorporates genetic evidence of the evolutionary relationships between penguins distant cousins like shearwaters albatrosses ducks and moas the researchers used dna from these birds to provide a broad framework of family relationships which together with the fossil evidence is used to predict when those birds must have arisen were really confident we have ancient birds and really confident about the date says fordyce its enabled us to establish an earlier timeframe for when groups of modern birds branched out most of the new zealand fossils officially recognised as the waimanu penguin genus were discovered by amateur palaeontologist al mannering in the waipara region just north of christchurch some million years ago new zealand had already separate from australia and antarctica and was a lowlying land mass much closer to the south pole waimanu manneringi would have developed in a polar habitat similar to todays yelloweyed penguin which it closely resembles its long bill and condensed wing bones indicate that it would be quite at home eating and swimming in todays antarctica the researchers say ant from the genus ectatomma foraging at the project amazonas field station in peru ants evolved far earlier than previously believed as far back as million to million years ago us researchers report and these insects have plants to thank for their diversity the harvard university team reports today in the journal science the researchers used a genetic clock to reconstruct the history of ants and found the ant family first arose more than million years earlier than previously thought but ants did not diversify into different genera and species until flowering plants came onto the scene the researchers conclude the study sheds light on one of the most important and numerous animals which includes hundreds of different species we estimate that ant diversification took off approximately million years ago along with the rise of flowering plants the angiosperms says team leader professor naomi pierce these plants provided ants with new habitats both in the forest canopy and in the more complex leaf litter on the forest floor and the herbivorous insects that evolved alongside flowering plants provided food for ants the researchers reconstructed the ant family tree using dna sequencing of six genes from ant genera encompassing of ant subfamilies around the world such molecular clocks are widely used alongside fossil and other evidence to determine how old species are they work on the basis that dna mutates at a steady and calculable rate the researchers found that the poorly known ant subfamily leptanillinae is the most ancient followed by two broad groups known as the poneroids or predatory hunting ants and the formicoids the more familiar species such as pavement ants and carpenter ants the outer rings of saturn top and uranus bottom in which each system has been scaled to a common planetary radius the newly discovered outer ring of uranus is bright blue for the same reason the earths sky is blue astronomers say its made up of tiny particles the ring is strikingly similar to saturns outer ring which astronomers last month confirmed was probably generated by one of the planets moons enceladus like saturns ring the uranus ring also has a small moon in it called mab but mab is too small and too cold to be spewing a geyser of ice that contributes to the ring as enceladus is now believed to be doing the outer ring of saturn is blue and has enceladus right smack at its brightest spot and uranus is strikingly similar with its blue ring right on top of mabs orbit says imke de pater a professor of astronomy at the university of california berkeley who helped lead the study i think there is no chance that the blue ring is caused by geyser activity adds de pater whose report is published today in the journal science we dont know what the composition of the particles is mab is probably covered with water ice like the other moons of uranus but that has nothing to do with the rings colour says de pater they are blue because they are tiny particles she says that is same reason why the sky is blue you have little particles that scatter light as blue light most other rings around planets in the solar system are red because of the size of their particles this is why astronomers missed uranuss outer ring for so long scientists were looking for it in the infrared light spectrum throwing up debris the scientists believe that meteoroids hitting mabs surface throw up debris the larger pieces remain in the moons orbit and eventually are swept up but smaller ones drift around more and eventually make up the ring the blue ring was only seen after researchers compared notes from nearinfrared observations by the keck telescope in hawaii and visiblelight photos taken by the orbiting hubble space telescope now they are looking for rings around other planets including mars rings are always easier to see when they are edgeon de pater says the interesting thing with uranus is that in the rings will appear edgeon she says in the rings will be times brighter saturns rings a second paper published in geophysical research letters shows that saturns prominent a ring contains more debris than once thought the cassinihuygens spacecraft now orbiting the planet has sent back ultraviolet images that show the ring is times thicker than originally thought a team at the university of colorado at boulder says the particles making up the ring range in size from dust grains to chunks as big as buses and orbit in long stringy clumps the same spacecraft helped planetary scientists discover the geyser on enceladus leading to speculation that the moon has a liquid water source under its frozen surface a new study shows we can only tolerate freeloaders for a short time after that societies prefer to punish them the idea of a happy cooperative society in which no one gets punished falls apart as soon as a few freeloaders show up a new study shows although most volunteers in the study first chose to join a group that did not use punishment most eventually left for a group that fined transgressors researchers from the university of erfurt in germany and the london school of economics report their findings today in the journal science the study can help us understand how to make society work more smoothly and can help in designing policies aimed at ensuring cooperation writes assistant professor joseph henrich a us anthropologist at emory university in georgia in a commentary even if nearly everyone is initially cooperative and contributes freeriders can profit and proliferate leading to the eventual collapse of cooperation he writes for example if most people in society are brave or conserve petrol he explains others benefit by evading military service or driving petrolguzzling cars playing games in the study researchers asked students to join one of two groups to play a game with tokens one group of players punished members who did not share freely while the other group did not the students could choose which group to join each player is endowed with money tokens and may contribute between and tokens to a public good the researchers write each group member equally profits from the public good independent of his or her own contribution in the punishment group members could choose to fine other members three tokens but it cost them one of their own tokens to do so twothirds of the students initially chose the group in which members could not punish others but many abandoned that group when they saw those in the punishment group were prospering more and former freeloaders were some of the most enthusiastic converts to the punishment mode the researchers found you cant explain this dramatic change in behaviour by saying that people are just looking for the best payoff people gave up payoff to follow the cooperative norm says erfurt researcher dr bettina rockenbach punishing the freeloaders dr bernd irlenbusch of the london school of economics adds he was surprised with the extent of punishment i was surprised so many of the freeloaders exerted punishment on others when they entered the sanctioning institution he says when the game ended after rounds the people in the punishment group had donated an average tokens per round meanwhile the liveandletlive group had almost no members and those who remained donated three tokens to the public good on average per round little actual punishment was applied during the later rounds of the game apparently because the threat of punishment was enough to ensure cooperation the researchers say a female australian redback spider eating a male spider australian redback spiders sniff out how much competition they have for females as theyre growing up and tailor their adult size accordingly say canadian researchers michael kasumovic and dr maydianne andrade of the university of toronto report their findings in the latest issue of the journal current biology males are really tracking the selection pressures that theyre facing in an environment theyre aware of male density and the amount of competition theyre going to be facing says kasumovic like most spiders male redback spiders are much smaller than the females but they vary in size kasumovic and andrade have found that an individual spiders development is determined by a tradeoff between traits that benefit a spiders sexual success versus their longer term survival a trait thats good for sex is often not good for surviving and a trait thats very good for surviving may not be good for sex says australian spider expert dr marie herberstein of macquarie university in sydney the classic example is the male peacocks tail she says which is good for attracting females but weighs him down and affects his chances of survival when being pursued by a predator she says kasumovic and andrade have found that when it comes to the redbacks maturing early is good for their sexual success but maturing later is better for survival the study kasumovic and andrade studied how immature male redbacks develop in the presence and absence of females they found that when females are not around the males develop into sexually mature adults slowly growing into relatively large adults with lots of energy stores this gives the male spiders a higher chance of survival when they set out on their search for female mates the researchers say but when male spiders are surrounded by females they focus their energy on maturing quickly ending up both smaller and leaner because they have spent less time foraging kasumovic and andrade say growing up fast gives the spiders the best chance of being first to mate with the nearby females something that is important considering the sex life of redbacks males redbacks only have one or two chances to mate before they are killed by the female and mating is most successful when the female is a virgin everybody always states that the small males are a byproduct of them not being able to get enough resources but were showing that theyre intentionally developing that way says kasumovic small and fat the researchers found that when both females and males are around male redbacks also grow up fast and small but they have more fat stores on their body than when other males were not around the researchers suspect that this extra fat gives the males the endurance to compete with other males for the extended courtship rituals that females prefer males are supposed to pluck and vibrate a females web strings for up to eight hours in the hope of gaining their favour in the experiment the males could not see or touch the females or males around them this means the spiders were responding to pheromones literally sniffing out their mates and potential competition a choice of strategy herberstein says the new research shows that male spiders choose which strategy to pursue depending on how they assess their environment as theyre maturing through this developmental plasticity the males can tailor their development depending on the situation they find themselves in she says playing violent video games can change the way you think a study says playing violent video games can make you think other people are out to get you research shows dr sonya brady of the university of california san francisco and professor karen matthews at the university of pittsburgh say their study shows that young men are more likely to see others attitudes toward them as hostile if theyve just played a violent game youre kind of on the lookout for other people being rude to you brady says brady and matthews had a group of male undergraduates aged to play one of two popular video games one game involved car theft and bashings and the second one pitted the player in a race to get homework to school on time in the nonviolent game players took the role of a parent and their task was to deliver their childs science project to school before it could be marked late in the violent game players took the role of a criminal and were instructed by the mafia to beat up a drug dealer with a baseball bat are you accusing me after playing the games study participants watched a scenario in which a teacher tells a class he suspects some students have cheated in a test the teacher says he is very disappointed in those who have cheated but proud of those who did well the teacher then asks to see billy after class the study participants were told to imagine themselves as billy and were asked how likely it was that the teacher was going to accuse them of cheating students whod played the violent game were more likely to think theyd be accused of cheating the researchers report in the archives of pediatrics and adolescent medicine more likely to approve of marijuana brady says the study also shows young men are more likely to think its acceptable to smoke marijuana and drink alcohol after playing a violent game she says this suggests that violent video games make players more likely to throw caution to the wind whether its with regard to their own health or any other type of risky behaviour parents have been told the message that violent video games and violent media in general can influence the likelihood that their kids will be aggressive brady says what this study suggests is that they might increase any type of risktaking behaviour playing the violent game boosted young mens blood pressure and appeared to have more of an effect on those who came from more violent homes or communities the study says but regardless of whether they grew up in a violent environment the young men who had played the violent game were less cooperative and more competitive in completing an assigned task with another person compared to those who played the nonviolent game the results show the potential for video games to change the way we think brady says a pump that extracts heat from sewage is being used to warm homes norwegians can now heat their homes and offices by flushing the toilet the sewage heat pump plant which began operating last week uses fridge technology to tap heat from raw sewage and direct it back to the countrys capital oslo machines at the end of a metre long tunnel in a hillside in central oslo suck heat from the sewer and transfer it to a network of hot water pipes feeding thousands of radiators and taps in the city similar systems have been used in other parts of the world but the norwegians say theirs is the biggest we believe this is the biggest heating system in the world using raw sewage says larsanders loervik managing director of oslo energy company viken fjernvarme which runs the plant the pump uses a system of compressors and condensers and generates megawatts enough heat to warm flats or save tonnes of oil a year he says exploiting sewage untreated sewage from toilets bathtubs sinks and rainwater from the streets flows into the system at degc and comes out at degc after heat is extracted with a refrigerant the energy goes to warming to about degc the water in a kilometre pipe system fed to offices and homes from a temperature of degc when it reaches the sewerage plant industrial waste burning plants also heat the water about a third of the heat energy comes from electricity driving the system and the other twothirds is the heat from the sewer dr monica axell head of the international energy agencys heat pump centre says the concept could be a feasible solution for many cities as long as they have the necessary infrastructure the only problem with the system is that flow in the sewers tends to be irregular monday mornings between am and am are especially dry in oslo because residents go to bed early on sunday but on weekends the flow is good says project manager for the oslo plant oyvind nilsen when people have been out to parties theres a lot of beer going into the sewer he says among other sewage energy projects worldwide us scientists are looking to generate electricity from sewageeating bacteria the microbial fuel cell work is going well but we still are not out of the lab on this technology says professor bruce logan of pennsylvania state university more search results arent the answer we need targeted results experts say googles new search engine technology wont solve all the problems of finding what you need but its a small step in the right direction information retrieval experts say the company has paid an undisclosed amount to license a new type of search algorithm recently designed in australia by university of new south wales phd student ori allon the search tool orion has been touted as the biggest thing in searching the web since the development of the google page rank algorithm by two stanford university researchers in the early s little has been disclosed about the software because of commercial confidentiality but the man who worked with allon to market his research says the system will make searching the net faster and easier when you put in a query it comes up with a list of associated keywords that specify your search to a greater depth says andrew stead business development manager of the newsouth innovations the commercial arm of the university of new south wales it actually goes into sites and extracts text so you can just scroll down a single page and derive the information you were looking for traditionally youve have to click through to the site but this means you dont have to click through and find that the sites incorrect luxury cars or football for example a search for a particular model of luxury car comes up with where to buy one a review of the car itself and an overview of the car manufacturer stead says the search is best suited to informationbased queries such as the rules of australian rules football rather than finding the home page of the australian football league but even stead says its not the end step in perfecting internet searches which some research suggests cover as little as just of the web search has got a long way to go before its going to give us what we want and this is one step in that path he says ranking pages dr peter bailey is project leader of the csiros information retrieval project and has been involved in designing a search engine designed for use within organisations like stead he says it appears that allons model has gone some way to addressing one of the biggest problems of searching the internet which is how information is ranked bailey says search engines work by trawling the net for documents on public websites the documents are then copied to form a sort of reverse index where words are linked to massive indexes of documents this is why the key to successful searching is ranking the material to reflect the needs of the searcher he says bailey were still far from the perfect search engine and current systems only address about of the problems involved in trawling the web for information the holy grail of internet searching includes tailoring searches to individuals accessing the whole internet and providing the perfect answer something he says may be as elusive as it is desirable graffiti is the modern equivalent of cave art an expert says both are produced by young men with adrenaline and sex on their minds testosteronefuelled boys created most prehistoric cave art according to a book by one of the worlds authorities on this type of art the theory contradicts the idea that adult tribal shaman spiritual leaders and healers produced virtually all of it it also explains why many of the images drawn in caves during the pleistocene between and years ago somewhat mirror todays artwork and graffiti largely produced by adolescent males today boys draw the testosterone subjects of a hot automobile fighter jet jedi armour sports direct missile hit etc all of the things they associate with the adrenaline of success says professor r dale guthrie author of the nature of paleolithic art i think the full larder of success of the excitement and danger of killing a giant bison or auroch in the pleistocene was the equivalent of the testosterone art today says guthrie who is an emeritus professor in the institute of arctic biology at the university of alaska fairbanks he says that many of the cave art images of animals are rather graphic showing for example speared animals with blood pouring out of their mouths and noses but hunting and animals were not the only things on the cave artists minds guthrie has also noticed that males were drawn with no defined sexual parts save for a simple line designating the penis few men were even represented but the images of women in caves tell a different story female images dominate and are nude almost every one fullfigured above and below says guthrie unlike the other animals the sculpted engraved and painted human females and female parts are sometimes done schematically distilling and inflating the primary and secondary sex characters learning to draw guthrie also determines that several cave art images are incomplete overlapping brief and rudimentary as though the people who created them were still learning to draw this type of sketching dominates cave walls which also display a handful of works that appear to have been drawn by wellpracticed artists who were probably adults perhaps the most convincing piece of evidence for the new theory consists of handprints that were left in the caves next to the art these prints were produced by people who chewed ochre held up a hand and then spit the colorful orangeyellow spew all over the hand leaving a wall imprint guthrie analysed the handprints and then compared the results with earlier research on male and female hands the hand lengths palm widths and the finger widths and lengths mostly match hands that would have belonged to boys aged nine to some teen female handprints were identified in the caves but young male prints were more common other handprints resulting unintentionally from people leaning against muddy cave walls as well as footprints also suggest that young boys were creating the cave art according to guthrie paul martin professor of quaternary biogeography at the university of arizona says he is inclined to agree with the new theory and findings guthrie has an extraordinary knowledge of wild animal ecology globally and especially in the northern hemisphere martin says in addition he brings detailed knowledge of late pleistocene fossils to his study of cave art finally like many zoologists especially those with children of their own he is an astute observer of human behaviour if he finds that much cave art reflects teenage or preteen preoccupations i am prepared to believe him he says this pampered pooch walks the same way as a greyhound or a labrador but why is the us military interested labradors and dachshunds appear to waddle while greyhounds seem to march by with a fast clip but new research shows the basic mechanics behind dog walking is the same for all canines the discovery could lead to a better understanding of health issues related to the way dogs walk like hip problems the researchers say and it could also result in improvements to fourlegged doglike robots which the us military is already investigating the big benefit would be to show how robot dogs should walk more efficiently says lead scientist dr jim usherwood a researcher from the structure and motion laboratory at the university of londons royal veterinary college almost all robots require a large amount of power much higher than an animal would use partly because they tend to use bent legs i show what would happen with stiff legs usherwood adds inspired by stifflegged mechanical toys that can walk down hills usherwood and his team designed several different computer models for dog walking the researchers then compared these models with observations of actual dogs on a treadmill their simple passive stifflimbed computer model best matched and explained the principles underlying dog walking the findings were recently presented at the annual meeting of the society for experimental biology in the uk like controlled falling walking for both bipeds and quadrupeds is like controlled falling because with each step the individual leans forward and is caught by an outstretched limb as a result there is a stage when the body is high and slow and a stage when the body is lower and faster usherwood explains with a fourlegged animal this has broadly been observed before but it had not been clear why and when these motions should happen he says my passive model makes it much easier to understand when and why the body moves up and down and changes in speed the model also found that walking happens on relatively stiff limbs unlike trotting where a dogs legs function like springs and tend to bend more this is true for bipeds such as humans but he says people put more energy into extending their legs while dogs appear to power themselves with torque around their hips similar to how weight is distributed on a bicycle dogs particularly older arthritic ones often suffer hip problems because if any two bones within the hip region lose their normal position the abnormal areas can grind against each other with each step over time abnormally shaped bone can grow and inflammation sets in since one condition fuels the other it becomes a vicious cycle usherwood hopes his model could help to clarify how this deadly cycle begins and worsens which eventually may lead to improved diagnosis and treatment harvard university scientists have come to similar conclusions regarding the mechanics behind dog walking russell main a concord field station researcher believes that dog legs work like two inverted pendulums where mechanical energy is usually recovered with each stride dr david lee and professor andy biewener also at harvard have already built a robot resembling a headless dog called bigdog that uses similar principles according to boston dynamics a research group involved in the project bigdog so far has trotted at about kilometres per hour climbed a deg slope and carried about kilograms in the future the us military which is helping to fund the research hopes to use bigdog for rescue operations and other possible fieldwork if your sex life isnt all smiles and fireworks are you sick or just going through a rough patch and whats a normal sex life anyway consumers are being marketed drugs for premature ejaculation without good evidence there is a medical problem to be treated an australian conference heard this week usbased psychologist and sex therapist dr leonore tiefer of the new york university school of medicine told the inaugural conference on diseasemongering in newcastle this week that premature ejaculation is the next sexual dysfunction to be marketed by the pharmaceutical industry this concerns tiefer because she says sexual difficulties are generally not biological problems that need medical treatment theres no sickness theres no pathology nothing is broken she says she says when men and women are counselled about what is distressing them sexually rapid ejaculation is of low importance tiefer says the way premature ejaculation is being marketed as a condition in need of treatment has all the hallmarks of disease mongering first she says drug companysponsored messages in the media have led to growing public awareness that premature ejaculation is regarded as a problem by experts who are measuring it defining it and finding cures for it these messages include helpseeking advertisements that urge people to ask your doctor about solutions to the problem the diseaseawareness campaign is in full force at this point says tiefer whats normal she says as a result people are now asking doctors what the normal speed of ejaculation is and wondering whether they meet the normal standard the answer is there is no such thing as normal she says theres a range some people are quick some people are slow most people are in the middle she says although there are no drugs yet specifically approved to treat premature ejaculation doctors are treating the condition with available drugs that are known to slow down the speed of ejaculation doctors are getting a lot of medical education about the offlabel uses of these drugs she says there are articles published there are conferences organised around this and there are drug companypaid people going out there and saying you can use this for this tiefer says health and science journalists are also writing about premature ejaculation and the help available for it poorly defined australian sociologist dr ross morrow of the university of sydney who also spoke at the conference agrees premature ejaculation is a suspicious condition to me this is a condition that is a very questionable medical category he says adding that the condition is poorly defined he says over the years there has been an attempt to define premature ejaculation according to the amount of time that lapsed or the number of thrusts that occurred before ejaculation occurred but no agreement has ever been reached morrow says the american psychiatric association defines it as persistent and recurrent ejaculation either before a man has intercourse during attempts at penetration or very shortly after intercourse begins in a way that is distressing to him or his partner and he says the definition relies on a clinicians judgement about whether the ejaculation is occurring too soon or not norms changing over time morrow also says norms about when men should ejaculate during coitus are constantly changing for example he says a study in by alfred kinsey discovered threequarters of men ejaculated within two minutes of coitus and regarded this as acceptable he didnt think that was a dysfunction says morrow he actually thought that was a sign of men being sexually responsive but morrow says during the s the period of time to ejaculation considered normal by experts was extended he says this coincided with a belief that womens lack of sexual satisfaction during intercourse could be addressed if her male partner could take longer to ejaculate morrow also says different cultures have different norms about how long men should take to ejaculate citing the case of one melanesian culture that considers ejaculation after to seconds normal morrow says in australia premature ejaculation is often mentioned in the same advertisements discussing erectile dysfunction and is sometimes referred to under the banner of ejaculatory problems he says antidepressant drugs used to delay or inhibit ejaculation are being currently used in impotency clinics in australia and sex therapists are also treating the condition using cognitive behavioural therapy female premature ejaculation both tiefer and morrow are also concerned about the notion of rapid orgasm the female equivalent of premature ejaculation i think its part of a transformation of sex from a subjective experience into a concrete performance almost like a sport with rules and goals and achievement standards says tiefer so you can define very clearly whether your performance is up to part and in that way products can be provided for you to achieve performance ore even exceed those expectations caulobacter crescentus uses its stalk to stick to solid objects harmless bacteria that live in rivers produce a biological superglue stronger than any ever measured scientists say researchers reporting recently in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences say the microorganism caulobacter crescentus sticks to surfaces three to four times more strongly than synthetic superglue the bacteria holds the secret for understanding how to prevent harmful bacteria from sticking to human tissue and causing disease the researchers say it also may help to produce a nontoxic superglue that could be used for anything from a dental adhesive to an industrial glue that works underwater to a surgical glue the advantage here is that these bacteria live in water and so they bind to all sorts of surfaces in water says team member yves brun professor of biology at indiana university this means that this glue is very versatile biologists including brun regularly study c crescentus as a biological model for understanding how other bacteria function over the course of other experiments brun realised the holding power of the tiny critters which attach themselves to surfaces with a stalklike appendage genes for stickiness to zero in on how they do it brun and his team began genetically manipulating the bacteria to remove specific genes needed to produce the adhesive eventually the scientists realised that variations of c crescentus lacking the genes required to produce chains of sugar molecules at the ends of the stalks could not hold fast to surfaces the scientists determined that the polysaccharide is a critical component of the adhesive they think that the sugar molecules are attached to supersticky proteins but they have yet to confirm which ones they also have indirect evidence that either there are other adhesive molecules involved or that the polysaccharide is somehow modified to make it stickier says brun how strong is the glue the researchers did however confirm just how tenacious the bacteria are jay tang an assistant professor of physics at brown university and his team stepped in to help measure the force required to pull the bacteria off a flexible glass pipette the researchers found that a single bacterium could withstand a stress of to micronewtons in other words the amount of bacteria that fit onto an australian cent piece or a us quarter could withstand being pulled by a force of four to five tonnes about the mass of an adult elephant the team also found enzymes that work to unglue the bacteria from a surface the work by the group at brown is exciting in its implications for better understanding natural adhesives and also in possible translation to new synthetic adhesives says professor dennis discher of the biophysics and polymers lab at the university of pennsylvania according to brun ultimately the bacteria would not be used as a glue itself but to produce the adhesive before that can happen the scientists have to pinpoint the genes required and devise a method for getting the bacteria to produce the glue in large quantities australopithecus anamensis fossils include teeth upper jaws hand and foot bones vertebral fragments a thigh bone and fragments of skull and jaw an international team of scientists has discovered million year old fossils in eastern ethiopia that fill a missing gap in human evolution the teeth and bones belong to a primitive species of australopithecus known as australopithecus anamensis an apeman creature that walked on two legs the australopithecus genus is thought to be an ancestor of modern humans seven separate species have been named and au anamensis is the most primitive this new discovery closes the gap between the fully blown australopithecines and earlier forms we call ardipithecus says professor tim white from the university of california berkeley whos team reports its find today in the journal nature we now know where australopithecus came from before million years ago the fossils were unearthed in the middle awash area in the afar desert of eastern ethiopia the area about kilometres northeast of addis ababa has the most continuous record of human evolution the researchers say the remains of the hominid that had a small brain big teeth and walked on two legs fits into the one millionyear gap between the earlier ardipithecus and au afarensis the famous fossil skeleton lucy which lived between and million years ago and was found in is an example of au afarensis it is fair to say that some species of ardipithecus gave rise to australopithecus says white fossil find the fossils from about eight individuals include the largest hominid canine found so far the earliest known thigh bone of the species and hand and foot bones the finding also extends the range of au anamensis in ethiopia previous remains of the species were found in kenya white says the large teeth suggest the hominid could eat fibrous foods and roots compared to earlier species of ardipithecus that had smaller teeth which restricted their diet along with the hominid fossils the scientists discovered hundreds of remains of pigs birds rodents and monkeys as well as hyenas and big cats which gave them an idea of the habitat in which they existed here in a single ethiopian valley we have nearly a milethick stack of superimposed sediments and horizons yielding hominid fossils these discoveries confirm the middle awash study area as the worlds best window on human evolution white adds the mona lisa has inspired many imitations like this poster advertising contact lenses hidden behind the mona lisas enigmatic smile are millions of invisible dots research shows according to research presented recently at italys uffizi gallery in florence the mona lisa consists of countless of dot layers applied with a technique of microdivided brushstrokes the dot research was revealed at the exhibition the mind of leonardo the universal genius at work which runs at the gallery until january jacques franck a consultant at the armand hammer center for leonardo studies at the university of california los angeles says the technique is somewhat similar to pointillism used by the french neoimpressionists in the late th century examples of this microdivision of tones exist since the ancient romans leonardo took an existing techniques but used it to the extreme like nobody else says franck the painting technique is called sfumato from the italian word fumo meaning smoke and it produces an almost d effect the result of the delicate brushwork that blends light shadow and contours da vinci never really explained how he was able to blend shadow and light in such an imperceptible way the only reference to the sfumato technique appears in his notes on the painting light and shade should blend without lines or borders in the manner of smoke he wrote applying science franck examined leonardos works using what he calls an archaeological approach he took a close look at another da vinci work drapery study for a seated figure which hangs in the louvre and noticed that leonardo used minute brushstrokes to produce the d effect of the draperies the technique is visible as he used tempera a type of emulsion of oil and water often using egg on the contrary in oil painting traces would have been masked by a delicate velatura or glaze franck says franck an artist himself has been copying leonardos works since he was eight and franck backed up his microdivision theory by reconstructing the mona lisas eye through six steps represented by panels on display at the uffizi exhibition he started with a poplar panel similar to the one leonardo used to paint the mona lisa in franck treated the panel with gypsum and animal glue then painted an eye with a brush but using black chalk then he applied a semiopaque diluted oilbased wash to soften the chalk lines and then retouched the details with microscopic brushstrokes he had to apply many layers until they blended together according to franck details such as the smile and eyes contain between and brush strokes per millimetre essentially leonardo was working as a miniaturist would he may have made one square millimetre a day this means it might have taken leonardo about years to complete the mona lisa franck says enigmatic smile lisa di antonio maria gherardini the mona lisa has been fascinating art lovers since her portrait was completed toward the end of the life of leonardo who lived from attempts to solve the enigma around her smile described by the th century artist and writer giorgio vasari as more divine than human have included theories that the noblewoman was happily pregnant suffering from asthma had facial paralysis or that the smile was the result of a compulsive gnashing of teeth francks theory is raising a debate among art historians i find it absolutely untrue leonardo did use the sfumato but his painting technique is also very firm i have seen the mona lisa under a magnifying glass and really i could not see any dot says da vinci scholar and uk professor of art history martin kemp from the university of oxford franck argues that it is scientifically impossible to distinguish the dots with a magnifying glass light penetrates each dot producing reflection diffraction and diffusion thus when you look at the painting the surface appears homogeneous no dot can be seen moreover in my works the dots completely disappeared within three years the same might have happened with the mona lisa franck says how about xray evidence indeed xray images of francks copies are very similar to xray pictures of the masters works they all show something similar to smoke the layers of paint are so thin that xray simply goes through franck says according to the curators of the exhibition francks hypothesis is convincing it is compatible with the material evidence of the mona lisa as analysed by the louvres laboratory they write in the exhibition catalogue venus south pole by day and night the left hand image is the view by day showing sunlight reflected from the tops of clouds the right hand image taken using infrared sensors shows a dynamic spiral cloud with the darker regions corresponding to thicker cloud cover the newly arrived venus express spacecraft has relayed the first view of the planets south pole revealing a dark vortex and an odd cloudtype structure were already experiencing the hot dynamic environment of venus says project scientist dr hakan svedhem venus express captured its first images of its host planet the day on wednesday the day after it slipped into orbit following a five month journey the europeanbuilt craft is expected to spend two venusian days which is more than a year on earth studying the planets dense and turbulent atmosphere the mission will attempt to learn why a planet so similar in size and composition to earth ended up so vastly different venus has an extremely thick and toxic atmosphere that traps heat more effectively than any other planet in the solar system its surface temperature is hotter than mercury which orbits closer to the sun and its atmospheric pressure is similar to earths pressure about a kilometre beneath the ocean although the new images are relatively lowquality when the probe reaches its final orbit scientists expect more than times better resolution researchers are intrigued by the clear structures and unexpected details seen in the planets atmosphere the sunlit images primarily show reflected light from venus cloud tops down to a height of about kilometres above the planets surface the night view which was taken using infrared sensors shows a dynamic spiral of clouds in the lower atmosphere similar to a structure previously seen at the planets north pole the pictures were taken from a distance of about kilometres zooming in on venus venus express is in the process of tightening its orbit which will eventually reach as close as kilometres above the planets surface venus express is the first spacecraft to visit venus since nasas magellan radar mapping mission of the s the probe is equipped with seven instruments many of which are spares from europes ongoing mars express mission and the rosetta comet probe researchers hope to unlock the history and mechanisms of venus dense and toxic atmosphere they want to understand how the presence of carbon dioxide water vapour and sulfuric gases trap heat in the planets atmosphere similar to how a glass greenhouse warms plants on earth chernobyl surrounded by a crumbling concrete outer layer which the international community hopes will by replaced by a sturdier steel jacket by twenty years ago explosions at the chernobyl power plant sent a huge radioactive cloud into the air in the worlds worst civilian nuclear accident that still affects millions of people today on april at am local time a series of explosions ripped through reactor four at the plant in the north of what is today ukraine near its border with belarus radiation fell across much of europe for days the soviet leadership refused to admit either to its own people or to the world what had happened less than kilometres north of a major city kiev and near the huge dniepr river that crisscrossed ukraine and provided much of its water supply only after the news blackout ended were people evacuated from the most affected areas around the plant to this day chernobyl fuels controversies over the use of nuclear power attracts tourists and researchers feeds fears of another release continues to claim victims and gobbles huge amounts of international funds an army of some liquidators firemen soldiers and civilians helped to construct a concrete sarcophagus meant to contain the reactor for to years before a more permanent structure could be built the fate awaiting these people and others exposed to radiation from the blast is one of the main controversies still surrounding the plant in its latest report on the disaster released in september the un estimates that fewer people will eventually perish than was initially predicted the report the work of some scientists from eight un agencies says up to will eventually die as a result of the accident in addition to the nearly people who have already died environmental groups like greenpeace reject the findings as whitewash collusion with the nuclear lobby and insulting for the victims they estimate that the death toll will be in the tens of thousands psychological problems in addition to health effects like thyroid cancer survivors also deal with psychological problems a study of more than liquidators by the serbsky psychiatric institute in moscow found that two thirds of them suffered from psychological illnesses considering their young age at the time of the accident all of the negative effects have not appeared yet says galina rumyantseva who led the study regions affected by the accident remain today both socially and economically devastated some people have been evacuated from the surrounding areas in all some hectares of prime agricultural land remain ruined as do hectares of forest the un estimates that the eventual price tag of the disaster will run to hundreds of billions of us dollars today the sarcophagus over reactor four is cracked and crumbling raising fears that more radiation can be released some countries have pledged to chip in more than us million toward the construction of a new tonne steel case the cover is expected to cost between us and billion dollars and is hoped to be finished by but it will take at least years to safely get rid of dangerous fuel and debris inside the plant says spokesperson yulia marusich the plant whose last reactor was shut down for good only in continues to attract attention tourists come to gawk while researchers come to observe the remarkable flourishing of flora and fauna hundreds of mostly elderly people who lived in villages around the plant have ignored government restrictions and warnings of radiation to resettle in the kilometre exclusion zone around the plant raising animals and eating fruits and berries from the radiationsoaked land the final effects from the series of explosions that occurred in the early hours at a soviet nuclear power plant in may not be known for years scientists say we may not see anything today but genetic modifications can appear in years says rudolf alexakhin director of the agricultural radiology institute in moscow workers set up the dig at visocica hill to look for evidence of an ancient pyramid the socalled bosnian pyramid of the sun excavation work has started north of sarajevo on what a bosnian explorer says are europes first pyramids a group of experts explored the narrow entrance of a kilometre tunnel believed to lead to one of the two hills resembling pyramids about kilometres from the bosnian capital as residents of the nearby town of visoko eagerly watched digging began on one of sites by metres on slopes of a hill covered by vegetation initial observations showed that the tunnel was manmade says geologist nadjia nukic after examining the initial unblocked section of the tunnel last year semir osmanagic a selfstyled bosnian explorer started initial investigations in the area convinced the constructions on visocica and pljesivica hills were the work of builders from an unknown civilisation he says further research using satellite pictures has provided more evidence for his case the images show the hills cooled a lot faster than their surroundings he says proving the substance of the structures was less dense and therefore probably made by humans with the paucity of contrary evidence the hills are presumed to be anthropogenic structures of potentially colossal proportions says bosnian geophysicist dr amer smailbegovic the explorers who are expected to be joined by an egyptian archaeologist and a geologist later in the year hope to find stone blocks or the steps of the pyramids osmanagic who wears an indiana joneslike hat and clothing and says he sharpened his eye for archaeology on numerous trips around the world says the two structures are precisely aligned with the four points of the compass on the outskirts of the town visocica hill which osmanagic refers to as the bosnian pyramid of the sun stands some metres high with a square base of more than by metres osmanagic says he sees astonishing similarities between the structures and mexican pyramids dating back to about ad which also come in pairs one believed to represent the sun and the other the moon the excavation work led by a recently established foundation of local archaeologists and volunteers will last for days the first results would be known in three weeks osmanagic says the director of the visoko historic heritage museum senad hodovic says he is no sceptic the pyramids are obviously the work of man but we need proper and serious analysis to show who built them and when hodovic says he has spent years urging authorities to support archaeological research on the plateau of the hill which is recorded in historic annals as the site of a medieval bosnian town he says the shape and monumental size of the structures is not typical for bosnian constructions of the middle ages visoko a small town that has been slowly dying from economic decline since bosnias war is hoping what has been dubbed the the new wonder of the world will offer it a brighter future pyramidmania seems to have caught everyone local souvenir shops selling oriental style coffee pots and plates now offer slippers ceramic coinboxes tshirts and brandy with pyramid logos seb the german shepherd smells sheep poo for a living a sniffer dog has been trained to tell which sheep have parasitic worms australian researchers show the dogs skills will be used to develop an electronic handheld sniffer device to detect gastrointestinal nematodes in sheep the parasite detection initiative has the potential to save the australian sheep industry millions of dollars a year say agricultural scientists at melbournes la trobe university internal parasites are a constant headache for sheep farmers because they cause serious production losses they can interfere with a sheeps wool and meat growth and make the animal weak and susceptible to other diseases they can even kill antiparasitic drugs have been the weapon of choice for a number of years however many parasites have become resistant to the drugs so the researchers tried something different scents and the use of sniffer dogs to detect them are used to determine the presence of a number of substances says chief investigator associate professor mark sandeman so we set out to ascertain whether the presence of intestinal parasites in sheep could be detected by their scent it seems they can with seb the female german shepherd being trained to detect parasiteinfected sheep droppings by its odour with accuracy we used seb in a classic training sense just as dogs are trained to detect drugs at airports we trained seb to detect parasites he says bags of infested poo were placed among bags of noninfested poo and seb was trained to pick out the infested sample the whiff of parasites sandeman says it is too early to say exactly which chemicals or groups of chemicals seb is sniffing out we dont know exactly what the dog is sniffing but were picking up some differences in terms of chemical signatures that would suggest there are a number of different compounds that are changed between infected and uninfected sheep he says the researchers are now working on developing an electronic handheld sniffer device similar to those used in the food manufacturing industry they are confident they will have a prototype within five years we thought about training dogs to use on farms but there were many technical difficulties so instead we thought it would be better to have some small device that farmers could use sandeman says he envisages a farmer holding the sniffer device near the rear end of sheep or near poo eventually the detector might be refined using biosensor technology and sheep may be checked automatically for parasites he says the australian sheep industry crc is funding the work hello mr personality researchers are learning that squid have distinct character traits squid have personalities that appear to be passed down from parent to offspring says an australian researcher but those traits can be modified by environment says dr david sinn who will present his research at the australasian association for the study of animal behaviour conference in sydney this week sinn a research fellow at the university of tasmania observed behaviour in the southern dumpling squid euprymna tasmanica which is found in waters around south australia victoria and tasmania in general these squid tend to be solitary unromantic animals with a propensity to cannibalise their neighbours and take sexual favours by force he says within that profile sinn found some squid are shy retiring cautious types while others are bold assertive and adventurous it turns out some squid are bolder than others he says for example when presented by a threatening stimulus they attack the stimulus or are ambivalent to it others are shyer they dont inspect a threat they back up they flee assertiveness training for squid previous research suggests these character traits in squid are up to hereditary he says but theres evidence that some squid can adapt to their environment by learning to either temper their overconfidence or shake off their shyness sinn says squid and other cephalopods like octopuses and cuttlefish are relatively intelligent and relative to body size have brains the size of cats this is probably to compensate for the loss of their protective shells during evolution he says with more brain capacity needed to protect their vulnerable bodies from predators population dynamics sinn says understanding the ecology and evolution of personality provides a key to understanding what drives animal populations he says its unclear which personality traits confer an evolutionary edge although it appears that having a mix of personalities is essential for a population to survive a disturbance individual behaviour is going to determine how far an animal population disperses its growth rate how well it survives and potentially how it reproduces so all these things are driving population dynamics he says if you want to know how to predict population abundance maybe we need to know more about individual behaviours and how theyre going to react to environmental change squid lovers sinns next project is to investigate the role of personality in the sex life of squid he says mating in the squid world is forceful on the part of the male but females play a role in choosing to associate with prospective mates or in attempting to rebuff unwanted advances he says early evidence suggests bolder females prefer bolder males while shy females are less choosy sinn also intends to look at personality in lizards web developers and doctors running clinical websites need to be aware of possible misuse of their online images us doctors warn porn seekers are finding a new source of online images doctors have discovered theyre downloading images of diseased genitalia from dermatology websites sites that were originally set up to educate doctors dr christoph lehmann and colleagues from johns hopkins university in baltimore noticed a marked jump in queries for images of genital areas from their searchable archive of clinical photographs they investigated and published their results in the latest issue of the journal of the american academy of dermatology the researchers assessed request patterns received by the site over months in terms of diagnosis age group and anatomical site of the more than dermatological images available on the site involve genital regions but of queries for a specific diagnosis involved a genital area also of the requests for an anatomical site involved a genital region and of the free text queries were for images of genitalia in searches that specified both an age group and an anatomical site images involving children were more likely to be requested than those involving an adult an analysis of the top referring sites to the dermatology service revealed that were pornographic or fetish sites but these sites only accounted for of all referrals developers of online clinical image libraries containing potentially sensitive health information on topics such as sexuality and anatomy must be aware of issues beyond technical and domain knowledge the authors say anonymous misuse of collaborative archives must be anticipated addressed and prevented to preserve their integrity and the integrity of the learning communities they support neurologists say people whose dreaming spills over into wakefulness may be prone to neardeath experiences the brains tendency to occasionally blur the line between sleep and wakefulness may help explain the phenomenon of neardeath experience preliminary research suggests its been an open question as to why some people see bright light feel detached from their bodies or have other extraordinary sensations when they are close to dying or believe they might die some people view these socalled neardeath experiences as evidence of life after death and many neurologists have considered the phenomenon too complex for scientific study but the new research published in the journal neurology implicates the blending of sleep and wake states as a biological cause researchers found that adults who say theyve had such an experience are also likely to have a history of whats called rem intrusion where aspects of the dream state of sleep spill over into wakefulness people may for example feel paralysed when they first wake up or have visual or auditory hallucinations as they fall asleep or awaken of the study participants whove had a neardeath experience have also experienced rem intrusion at some point in their lives that compares with of adults in a comparison group arousing the body the findings suggest that the brains arousal system predisposes some people to both rem intrusion and neardeath experience according to the study authors led by dr kevin nelson a neurologist at the university of kentucky in lexington this arousal system nelson says regulates not only rem sleep but also attention and alertness during waking hours including during dangerous situations and many of the features of rem intrusions he says parallel those of neardeath experience during rem sleep visual centres in the brain are highly active while the limb muscles are temporarily paralysed so rem intrusion during peril could promote the visions of light and sensation of being dead that people often have during a neardeath experience according to nelson not the whole story other evidence supports a role for rem intrusion in neardeath experiences he says one important fact nelson notes is that stimulation of the vagus nerve which connects the brain stem to the heart lungs and intestines triggers rem intrusion and heightened activity in this nerve is sure to be part of the bodys fightorflight response to danger still nelson says he doesnt think rem intrusion will turn out to be the whole explanation for neardeath experience and the findings shouldnt detract from the meaning people have taken from their experiences my work is spiritually neutral nelson says noting the research can only look at how the brain contributes to neardeath experience and not why the phenomenon occurs the why cant be addressed by scientific inquiry he says grooming is important to cattle but would they use a hairbrush if they had hands beef cattle use tools to keep their coats healthy says an australian researcher suggesting they are more than all brawn and no brains animal behaviour scientist bob kilgour who works for the new south wales department of primary industries observed the grooming behaviour of various breeds of beef cattle at pasture on a number of properties over several days he found they spend about of their day grooming and preening themselves even in the absence of parasites they mainly use their tongues and hind hooves to groom the rear end of their bodies kilgour says but they also use inanimate objects like trees branches fence posts and stumps to get at areas they cant reach he says theyll walk up to fallen tree limbs which have protruding branches and groom around their eyes he says so theyre making very finely controlled motor movements to groom around sensitive parts of their body kilgour will tell the australasian association for the study of animal behaviour conference in sydney this week that this deliberate choice of different kinds of objects suggests they are being used as tools he says this is a bold suggestion because the definition of tool use conventionally relies on an ability to hold and manipulate objects these are animals that cant pick things up and manipulate them but nonetheless they are making decisions about what they are going to use to groom their bodies he says im postulating this could redefine our idea of tool use its difficult to relate this to intelligence but id just like to say theres a lot more going on up there than we really know about comparisons with similar species kilgour compared grooming behaviour of beef cattle with undomesticated but related species including bison water buffalo banteng and eland he found similar grooming patterns this suggests an evolutionary purpose for grooming kilgour says for example maintaining the integrity of their coat may protect against invasion by parasites bacteria or grass seeds if you find this behaviour occurs in closely related species you can say this confers some survival advantage on animals therefore its a necessary behaviour he says so in production systems like feedlots where we try to stop animals grooming because we dont want to push the fence posts over we may be thwarting what is a valuable natural behaviour he says attempts to prevent grooming may therefore be misguided and a denial of the animals right to express normal behaviour one of the central elements of animal welfare this new type of brainmachine interface could replace joysticks in online gaming or be used as a communication tool for pople who cannot speak or sign a computerised keyboard that translates electrical impulses from brainwave signals into letters and words could be available in the next five years german researchers say in the short term the technology will allow its developers from the fraunhofer institute and the chariteacute university hospital in berlin to watch a brain function in real time but in the long term such a brainmachine interface could replace the joystick in electronic gaming or serve as a communication tool for people unable to speak or sign we are dreaming of something like a baseball cap with electrodes in the cap that can measure the brainwaves says one of the scientists behind the project professor klausrobert muumlller of the fraunhofer institute people could just put on the cap and have a wireless connection from these electrodes to a computer and they can play video games measuring brainwaves that vision says muumlller will require advances in electrode technology that allow the tiny metal sensors to pick up electric signals from brainwave activity without making contact with the skin for now muumlller and his colleagues are still somewhat constrained by the conventional electrode cap which looks like a swimmers cap embedded with or contact points and a web of wires leading to a computer each electrode embedded in the cap must be smeared with a conductive gel before the cap is fitted properly to a persons head a process that can take minutes to an hour muumlller and his teams technology involves special software once the electrode cap is in place the person must calibrate the computer to their individual brainwaves whereas other research projects may require a person to spend hours practising with the machine before calibration is finalised the fraunhofer system takes only minutes the berlin group is very strong and focused on the computer learning the pattern says robert leeb a braincomputer interface researcher at graz university of technology in austria leeb works in a team developing a machine that propels a person through a virtual environment based on brain signals imagine moving your hand during calibration with the berlin groups technology the person imagines moving his left or right hand the signals picked up by the electrodes are processed in a specially written computer program that filters out signals from thoughts not related to moving the object and homes in on the brain activity responsible for the imagination of movements once the person is in sync with the computer he can imagine moving his hands or feet or rotating an object to trigger an action on the screen in the brain there is one specific area on the cortex that is active during left hand motor imagery and another one that is active during right hand motor imagery says team member dr benjamin blankertz these mental tasks are discriminated by their brain activity patterns and can thus be used for braincomputer interface control additional computer screens present various data indicating brain activity which the team monitors closely the researchers goal is to capture and display many more psychological measures such as those that reveal cognitive workload attention stress and vigilance the work could open the door on a wealth of information about how the brain functions not to mention improve how it controls images onscreen with just a thought the researchers say banning the fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics in animal feed means humans are more likely to respond to these powerful antibiotics if they need them reducing the use of antibiotics in foodproducing animals leads to less drug resistance in humans an australian study confirms for the first time researchers examined samples from people with gastroenteritis due to the nations most common bacterial cause of foodborne disease campylobacter jejuni tests identified a low level of resistance to the fluoroquinolone group of antibiotics which australia has banned in foodproducing animals like poultry one investigator senior lecturer in epidemiology at the australia national university in canberrra dr mahomed patel says flouroquinolones are powerful newer generation antibiotics that should be reserved for pretty severe infections in humans the study found that only of the australianacquired campylobacter infections were resistant to ciprofloxacin a type of flouroquinolone in countries that allow fluoroquinolones to be used in animals ciprofloxacin resistant strains are up to times more common in humans studies show drug resistance could make these infections hard to treat lengthen bouts of diarrhoea and increase risk of serious or fatal illness the very low level of ciprofloxacin resistance in c jejuni isolates likely reflects the success of australias policy of restricting use of fluoroquinolones in foodproducing animals researchers say in a paper to be published in the journal clinical infectious diseases those tested were from queensland south australia victoria tasmania and western australia states that require reporting of patients infected with the bacteria and were hospitalised with gastroenteritis or remained in the community patel says it is unknown why ciprofloxacin resistance ranged from among tasmanian patients to in infected victorians but as expected there were much higher rates of resistance to other antibiotics among australianacquired infections especially those more commonly used by people in the community international evidence he says this is the first australian study to support evidence seen in countries such as sweden and norway that banning use in animals means low rates of fluoroquinoloneresistant campylobacter infections in humans it confirms australia has remained relatively free of problems because weve never used these antibiotics in animals avoiding animal use has prevented resistance in humans patel says those infected outside australia were more likely to have a resistant strain especially if they had travelled to asia reasons could include contact with an infected person or eating meat from an animal with the resistant bacteria patel says in australia causes could include medical treatment with the antibiotics eating imported contaminated food or acquiring resistance in hospital the newly discovered dinosaur looked like trex pictured here but had a longer narrower skull and shorter bladelike teeth remains of an enormous species of carnivorous dinosaur longer than all other previously identified meateating dinos have been found in argentina scientists say researchers announced that the newly discovered meat muncher mapusaurus roseae belongs to a group of gigantic carnivorous dinosaurs called carcharodontosaurids this group includes giganotosaurus the largest meateating dinosaur to ever walk the earth the discovery of the new dinosaur in western patagoniais is published in the latest issue of the journal geodiversitas palaeontologists say mapusaurus was more than metres long and had a shinbone that was longer than that of giganotosaurus but the current recordholder retains its largest title because giganotosaurus would have been wider and heavier than mapusaurus nevertheless the new dinosaur would have been an intimidating creature especially when it was part of a group hundreds of bones researchers found hundreds of mapusaurus bones dating to million years together in a pack that would have included metre long juveniles and adults which were more than metres long this is arguably the nastiest thing ever found as it is the first pack found for giant meateating dinosaurs says dino don lessem who participated in the dig and helped to fund it lessem a dinosaur expert who was a consultant on the film jurassic park says that mapusaurus would have lived at the same time as the largest animal that ever lived argentinosaurus which was a metre long planteating dinosaur in a pack mapusaurus could take down this herbivore despite its weight times more than even this largest of meat eaters he says like trex philip currie who also worked on the excavation and is a professor of biological sciences at the university of alberta says the new dinosaur somewhat resembled tyrannosaurus rex mapusaurus looked something like t rex but had a longer narrower skull currie explains its teeth were shorter and more bladelike the teeth and long skull were better adapted to biting big chunks of meat out of sauropod dinosaurs t rex on the other hand had longer thicker teeth for biting through the bones of its prey the palaeontologists therefore think the newly discovered carnivore both scavenged and hunted for meat hunting in packs dr rodolfo coria who also worked on the excavation and is a palaeontologist at the carmen funes museum in argentina says that mapusaurus may have been unique among carnivores in that it seemed to live a more social life as it was found in a pack t rex and virtually all other carnivorous dinosaurs usually are solitary specimens suggesting they mostly lived and hunted alone coria says it is possible the big meat eaters evolved different habits for each species and mapusaurus simply may have been more social the pack even appears to have passed away together in a mass dieoff dr michael ryan curator and head of vertebrate palaeontology at the cleveland museum of natural history examined the dinosaur bones on a recent trip to patagonia he agrees with the other palaeontologists this new discovery helps us better understand the diversity of giant carnivorous dinosaurs says ryan even more interesting is the fact that the find contains the remains of multiple individuals of different sizes and ages the new groundbased telescope will give images times crisper than the hubble space telescope australian astronomers have joined a consortium building the worlds largest telescope which from will help scientists understand the evolution of the universe the australian national university has become equal partners with eight us institutions to design the us million a million optical and infrared giant magellan telescope the new telescope is to be built in chile and will consist of six mirrors surrounding a central mirror with each mirror metres across at an overall diameter of metres the new telescope will be the first of a generation of socalled extremely large telescopes designed to probe the depths of the universe the largest telescopes that astronomers have access to right now have diameters between and metres says professor penny sackett director of the universitys research school of astronomy and astrophysics based at mount stromlo in canberra extremely large telescopes have diameters of to to metres sackett says the lightgathering power increases with the square of the diameter of a telescope when you go from an metre to a metre telescope youve actually increased your lightgathering power by a factor of nine not by a factor of three light from distant stars she says the telescopes enormous diameter will allow it to detect light from the most distant stars in the universe the light has taken so long to reach earth it is almost the age of the universe which means it gives astronomers a picture of the universe right after it was born says sackett she says the giant magellan telescope will be the first telescope to directly detect light from planets that are just forming around other stars the telescope will also allow astronomers to study dark matter and dark energy which influence the geometry of the universe dark matter and dark energy are the forces that tug and pull on the fabric of spacetime they determine how the universe evolves over time she says clear focus sackett says the telescope will have adaptive optics new technology that undoes the blurring effects of the earths atmosphere the mirrors move very quickly to put the light rays back in the right place by bouncing them at slightly different angles she says the giant magellan telescope should be able to take pictures that are times crisper times sharper times more detailed that the hubble space telescope partnership in the new telescope will give australian astronomers access to an extremely large telescope which according to the decadal plan for astronomy is one of the two items australian astronomers say are the most important to their future a decade from now sackett says that australian industries and academic institutions could also benefit from contracts to design and build instruments for the new telescope other members of the consortium are the carnegie institution of washington harvard university massachusetts institute of technology university of arizona university of michigan smithsonian institution university of texas at austin and texas am university when black holes collide they spiral towards each other then shed vast amounts of energy as spaceripping gravity waves powerful ripples that rend the fabric of space as black holes collide have been simulated for the first time by a supercomputer finally giving astronomers something specific to watch for with new gravity wave telescopes black holes collapsed stars tens to billions of times more massive than the sun are believed to merge fairly often in the cosmos as they get trapped by each others gravity when it happens they spiral towards each other and shed up to of their energy in the form of powerful spacetorturing gravity waves according to the new simulation these waves propagate through the universe and researchers say the waves ought to be detectable with the right equipment for years we didnt know what to expect says dr joan centrella chief of the gravitational astrophysics laboratory at nasas goddard space flight center in maryland the researchers used the worlds fourthfastest computer nasas columbia supercomputer to crunch the numbers in some of einsteins toughest equations regarding black holes theyve come up with a basic gravity wave signature of a black hole merging process from start to finish now we have einsteins prediction she says this is a conceptualisation that we didnt have until now computer power the new gravity wave simulation is the culmination of three decades of research that until recently required more computer power than was available the results are being published in the journals physical review letters and physical review d for a long time theyd just crash and burn she says of earlier computerised attempts to run einsteins equations on the theory of general relativity in the end it took a fifth of columbias parallel computer processors about hours to crunch the complex yearold equations added up processorbyprocessor the calculations took more than years of processor time centrella says the researchers were pleased to discover one of their results regardless of the different possible orbits and speeds two black holes have when they begin to merge they end up producing the same signature wave patterns as they near the end of their collision centrella says that should make them pretty easy to identify the next step will be to detect some actual gravity waves and see if they match the simulation that will be in effect one tremendous test of einsteins work on black hole theory says centrella it will also mark the genuine birth of a whole new field of astronomy black holes play a key role in gravitational wave astronomy says astronomer professor peter saulson of syracuse university in new york they will be the primary source of gravity waves searching for gravity waves saulson works on the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ligo in hanford washington which started searching the skies for gravity waves late last year ligo with its kilometrewide antenna ought to be able to detect gravity waves from the collisions of smaller black holes says saulson as for the far larger supermassive black holes found at the centres of galaxies their gravity waves will require a spaceborne observatory that can detect much lower frequency gravity waves he says thats the goal of nasas laser interferometer space antenna which will have three spacecraft million miles apart and linked by lasers due to be launched in huge underground antarctic lakes like lake vostok pictured here are connected by fastflowing underground rivers that stretch for hundreds of kilometres scientists have found huge powerful rivers that may connect subglacial lakes deep under the antarctic ice uk researchers who discovered the plumbing system that moves water hundreds of kilometres say it challenges the notion that the lakes under the antarctic ice evolved independently and could support ancient life previously it was thought water moves underneath the ice by very slow seepage says professor duncan wingham of university college london ucl who headed the research team but this new data shows that every so often the lakes beneath the ice pop off like champagne corks releasing floods that travel very long distances scientists had plans to drill through the ice to take samples from the lakes but were worried about contaminating them with new microbes we had thought of these lakes as isolated biological laboratories now we are going to have to think again wingham says the research reported today in the journal nature also means that water from the antarctic lakes which were first discovered in the s could have flowed into the ocean in the past and could do so again about subglacial lakes have been discovered in antarctica but researchers believe there could be thousands lake vostok at million years old is thought to be the oldest looking at satellite images scientists from ucl and the uks natural environment research council centre for polar observation and modelling found the rivers by examining changes in measurements taken by the european space agency ers satellite of a region in east antarctica known as the dome concordia they noticed that the ice surface was metres lower over one subglacial lake but it bulged by metre at two other subglacial lakes about kilometres away they suspect these changes show a flow of water from one subglacial lake to the others and calculate cubic kilometres of water would have moved over months the lakes are like a set of beads on a string where the lakes are the beads connected by a string or river of water says wingham the scientists believe when the pressure in one of the lakes increases a flood fills the next bead down the string but they do not know whether the flow of water that melts ice causes a chain reaction down the string a mere drop iceland has underground lakes that fill quickly and flush out says canadian researcher professor garry clarke from the university of british columbia but clarke says in the same issue of nature they discharge water times faster than in antarctica the actual discharge in antarctica was hardly catastrophic he writes and the antarctic outflow is miniscule compared with the megafloods of the last ice age clarke writes how outflows from glacial lake missoula in what is now north america was times more powerful than the uk researchers found in antarctica young children are being medicated for an illness that some psychiatrists say doesnt exist children as young as two years old are being inappropriately diagnosed and medicated for bipolar disorder says a uk psychiatrist professor david healy of cardiff university told the inaugural conference on diseasemongering recently in newcastle australia that increasing numbers of children are being treated for the condition with drugs that carry serious sideeffects without evidence the condition exists in that age group healy says bipolar disorder is a condition in which someones mood swings between highs and lows and in its most serious form this can lead to acts of suicide he says until recently most people believed the illness only affects older teenagers or adults but the diagnosis is now being applied to young children particularly in the us he says children as young as two who are tricky to handle overactive or difficult in some way are being diagnosed with bipolar disorder and he says they are increasingly prescribed drugs known as mood stabilisers which are used to treat the condition in adults and have serious sideeffects he says american psychiatric association apa diagnostic guidelines specify that periods of highs and lows should last for weeks at a time at least but he says children being diagnosed as having bipolar disorder have moods that go up and down during the course of a day every kids mood goes up and down during the course of the day he says healy says advocates of using the diagnosis on children say the apa guidelines should be changed the response from most of the rest of the world is that the americans have gone hysterical expanding treatment healy believes that the diagnosis of children with bipolar disorder is part of a general trend towards increasing the number of people treated with mood stabilisers which he says have risks that are downplayed and benefits that are overplayed he says while a very small percentage of people have the serious form of bipolar disorder that might warrant medication recently people with relatively mild mood swings have been treated and this is now including children healy says this spread of diagnosis is reflected in the increasing number of books on bipolar disorder aimed at clinicians parents and children what he describes as a watershed book called the bipolar child the definitive and reassuring guide to childhoods most misunderstood disorder sold hardback copies in its first six months indicating huge support for the diagnosis he says and books for children look for all the world like versions little red riding hood or cinderella or whatever he says they come in the same pastel colours they show scenes of a kid who was getting into trouble and then being helped out by a kindly doctor who explains theyve got a chemical imbalance and that medication will help healy is paid by the pharmaceutical company astrazeneca to give talks on mental illness australian psychiatrists also concerned chairperson of the royal australian and new zealand college of psychiatrists faculty of child and adolescent psychiatry dr phill brock is also concerned about children being inappropriately diagnosed with bipolar we do not endorse that diagnosis in children he says brock runs the inpatient service of the womens and childrens hospital in adelaide and says he is aware the diagnosis is being made both by gps and psychiatrists we would contend that because of the developmental context were not able to say categorically that this is an illness that can be applied to children he says he is aware of advocates for diagnosing bipolar in children and found it alarming when a us organisation approached the faculty he represents months ago to set up a support group for infants and children with bipolar disorder healy says while a child might be hard to handle because theyve moved house or school because theyve been bullied at daycare or because their parents arent getting on it is easier to locate to the problem in the child brock is similarly concerned we know that children and teenagers frequently have changes in mood thats part of growing up he says for more information on bipolar disorder including fact sheets and referrals see beyondblue australias national depression initiative more than half of the authors of the dsm the manual used to diagnose mental health problems have had ties with the pharmaceutical industry but not everyone agrees this is a bad thing most of the experts who wrote the manual widely used to diagnose mental illness have had financial ties to drug makers such as research funding or stock holdings us researchers report they call for full disclosure of the relationships between companies and the medical experts on panels that craft future editions of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders known as the dsm transparency is especially important when there are multiple and continuous financial relationships between panel members and the pharmaceutical industry because of the greater likelihood that the drug industry may be exerting an undue influence the researchers write in a study to be published in the journal psychotherapy and psychosomatics the american psychiatric association which publishes the dsm says it will require financial disclosures for the next version due out in the study found of psychiatric experts who worked on the most recent edition published in had at least one financial link to a drug maker at some point from through the relationships included speaking or consulting fees ownership of company stock payment for gifts and travel and funding for research all the experts who developed sections defining mood disorders schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders had such links the study says the connections are especially strong in those diagnostic areas where drugs are the first line of treatment for mental disorders the study says critics say psychiatric drugs are overprescribed drug company links fruitful say some dr darrel regier director of the american psychiatric associations research division says the study is an attempt to develop probably some guilt by association with the pharmaceutical industry he says he does not believe financial connections to companies influenced development of the manual if none of the experts were involved with the industry that would mean they were really out of step with the major advances in the treatment of mental illness he says the authors of the new study researchers from the university of massachusetts and tufts university say they based their findings on searches of various databases financial disclosures in medical journals and other records they say they could not determine if the experts had ties to the companies while they were working on the manual after the update but dr lisa cosgrove one of the studys authors says the associations could raise questions even if they occurred after the experts update the dsm they can certainly leverage their participation on the dsm which is very prestigious into lucrative consulting contracts says cosgrove a clinical psychologist at the university of massachusetts in boston a spokesperson for the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america says the industry group has not yet reviewed the study but it is important to note that the physicians and other health care professionals who sit on expert medical advisory panels have impeccable integrity and base their decisions on independent judgments and research he says the weight of a saddle and rider can cause a horses back to extend and in extreme cases cause vertebrae to grow together when a horse bears the weight of a rider it adjusts the position of its back and alters its limb movements which could contribute to back pain and injury researchers say the finding adds to a growing body of evidence that horses used for recreation or sport are at risk of health problems many scientists such as patricia de cocq who led the recent study hope the findings will improve future conditions for horses the goal of this study is to advise horse trainers and saddle fitters on how to prevent injuries says de cocq a researcher in the experimental zoology group at wageningen university in the netherlands for the study de cocq placed special infrared light reflective markers on horses that were on treadmills infrared cameras used the reflected light to generate d images that focused on horse back vertebrae joints and limbs as the animals walked with and without loads the maximum total weight was about kilograms she found that while all weight caused a horse to adjust its back position the saddle with a rider led to the greatest adjustment during walk trot and canter the position of the horses back is more extended in the situation with a saddle and weight de cocq says although the back is more extended during the complete stride cycle total movement expressed as range of motion stays the same the findings were presented at the society for experimental biologys annual meeting in england earlier this month kissing spines and other ailments the back extension according to de cocq is consistent with probable causes for the condition of kissing spines when loads and repeated undulations push parts of the horses back close together this usually happens between the withers and the loin or in the region that involves the th th vertebrae in advanced cases sometimes parts of the spine grow together it is thought that the process is only painful in this acute phase she says horses with longer backs are more likely to suffer from back problems associated with riding probably because of uneven weight distribution de cocq says it is possible that horses bred to bear heavy loads such as icelandic horses may be less vulnerable but she says she has not studied these horses yet on the racetrack back problems are not the only risk to horses that carry human riders a recent journal of the american veterinary medical association study found that some racehorses experience haemorrhaging from the pulmonary artery into the bronchial tubes and windpipe during intense exercise the disorder is most commonly found in horses that lost races and trailed the winner by an average of about metres half of all thoroughbreds experience this problem called exerciseinduced pulmonary haemorrhage according to lead author kenneth hinchcliff a professor of veterinary clinical sciences at ohio state university he says a number of treatments including drugs and herbal products are often administered before racing but it is not clear if they always work for horse riders de cocq offered this advice riders should pay attention to the signals a horse can give for example cold back when a horse stiffens its back or negatively reacts after bearing weight problems with saddling girthing and mounting the horse may be an indication that there are problems with the saddle or the riding technique electromagnetic radiation from mobile phones may affect how fast you brake or turn while driving electromagnetic radiation from your mobile phone may impair your ability to make snap decisions say when driving a car an australian study shows the study which will be published in the journal neuropsychologia found evidence of slowed reactions on both simple reactions and more complex reactions such as choosing a response when there is more than one alternative the researchers found these effects after people were exposed to electromagnetic radiation equivalent to spending minutes on the phone lead researcher professor con stough director of the brain sciences institute at swinburne university of technology in melbourne says the reactions tested experimentally have reallife equivalents such as making braking decisions when driving a car if you are driving a car and somebody runs out in front you your simple reaction time is the time it takes to brake while your choice reaction time could be the time it takes to decide between braking turning left turning right or hooting the horn to avoid the collision he says the studys volunteers received either active or sham radiation emissions for minutes before swapping for a further minutes this meant a total active exposure of minutes equivalent to a long phone call the researchers then tested the study participants reaction times and memory using a battery of neuropsychological tests as well as the effect on reactions times the study found that radiation from mobile phones seems to improve working memory used for example when remembering a phone number long enough to dial it but stough says this memory finding should be interpreted with caution because the underlying biological mechanism is not known a small effect stough emphasises that while the study raises the possibility that shortterm exposure of mobile phone emissions affect brain activity the effect is small further investigations such as functional magnetic resonance imaging are needed to confirm the neuropsychological changes associated with mobile phone emissions he says whether the results will affect the way in which people make decisions about using mobile phones i dont know mobile phones are such a part of how we operate these days that it is unlikely researchers are still debating about whether mobile phones have a carcinogenic effect but the world health organization says there is insufficient evidence to support this argument and studies are ongoing sleep studies however lend support that mobile phone emissions alter brain activity recent findings show that that electromagnetic radiation received after making a mobile phone call stimulates the brain during the early stages of sleep erosion can affect the rate at which mountains in new zealand grow says a researcher mountains eroded by the wind and rain can actually grow larger according to a canadian geophysicist associate professor russell pysklywec of the university of toronto says he is the first to predict that events on the earths surface can affect geological processes hundreds of kilometres below pysklywec publishes his research on how erosion affects the way tectonic plates collide to form mountains in the current issue of the journal geology mountains form in a number of ways including subduction when two plates collide and the edge of one plate slides under the other pushing up the crust in the process eventually these mountains clog up the subduction zone pysklywec says and change the way the plates collide so the subduction zone shifts elsewhere over time the original mountains start to erode as new mountains form elsewhere in the new subduction zone but when wind and rain wash away the material pushed up at the subduction zone pysklywec says the subduction zone does not get clogged up and this makes it easier for the mountains to keep growing there he says this is a paradox after all youd expect erosion to wear down mountains not build them up he says the rate of erosion is critical erosion doesnt really lower mountains very much because typically the erosion occurs at the same rate or less than the rate of plate convergence says pysklywec who has developed a computer model to simulate what happens natural laboratory pysklywec studied the southern alps of new zealand which have been forming with the collision of the pacific and australian plates a process that began million years ago he says these mountains are the perfect natural laboratory for studying mountainbuilding because they are relatively young which makes it easier to decipher the geological processes that are going on but pysklywec says his findings apply to any area of the world where plates collide and mountains form he says the effect of erosion on deep earth processes has been ignored because it is hard to imagine how erosion which typically removes centimetre of surface soil per year can affect kilometrethick tectonic plates but you have to multiply that by million years he says and all of a sudden its not centimetre of material its tens of kilometres of material that youre taking away a hot topic in tectonics australian geophysicist dr wouter schellart of the australian national university in canberra says researchers have been studying the effect of erosion on tectonic processes but geologists are debating what effect it has previous research has focused on the first kilometres of the earths crust he says but pysklywecs research shows erosion can impact processes deep down as far as a few hundred kilometres yet schellart wonders whether this latest research applies to mountains other than those in new zealand and he says the model doesnt account for where eroded sediment is deposited in real life its normally deposited right in front of the mountain belt he says adding that this will push both plates downwards he also says the rocks making up the earths crust in pysklywecs model are weaker than they should be which potentially overestimates the effect of erosion gm cotton fights back against the helicoverpa armigera caterpillar but this transgenic cotton has its drawbacks say some scientists see related stories below research that led to genetically modified cotton australias first transgenic broadacre crop has been awarded a prestigious award three csiro scientists were last night presented with an atse clunies ross award for their work on bt cotton they were among researchers in the fields of environmental science metallurgy information technology and physics to be presented with an award in recognition of their outstanding achievements in the application of science and technology for the social and economic benefit of australia csiros plant molecular biologist dr danny llewellyn plant breeder and agronomist dr greg constable and entomologist dr gary fitt were awarded jointly for their work in combating the moth helicoverpa armigera the most destructive pest to broadacre crops csiro licensed a gene from us biotechnology company monsanto that produced a toxin from the bacteria bacillus thuringiensis or bt the researchers then introduced the gene into australian cotton plants when the h armigera caterpillar eats the transgenic cotton plant the toxin attaches to its gut and poisons it this alternative approach to pest management has reduced the use of chemical pesticides by saving farmers about a million a year on spraying the researcher say it used to cost a million annually to spray cotton crops with pesticide to control the moth but now they only use about of the insecticide they used to use says constable the team leader the main issue was insecticide could contaminate land air and water so this is safer for the environment and everyone as it only kills the moth without harming other helpful insects creatures or humans other award winners were environmental scientist dean cameron from biolytix technologies in brisbane for developing a waste treatment

bacteria helicobacter pylori rather than stress causes stomach ulcers was guest speaker at the awards ceremony choosing the racy red shoes over the sensible loafers relates to how your brain assigns values to items or goods cant choose between the racy red shoes and the sensible loafers scientists say this indecisiveness relates to how your brain cells assign values to different items researchers at harvard medical school in boston have identified neurones that seem to play a role in how a person selects different items or goods scientists have known that cells in different parts of the brain react to attributes such as colour taste or quantity now dr camillo padaoaschioppa and associate professor john assad describe in the journal nature how neurones involved in assigning values help people to make choices the neurones we have identified encode the value individuals assign to the available items when they make choices based on subjective preferences a behaviour called economic choice padoaschioppa says the scientists say this research is part of the emerging field of neuroeconomics the scientists located the neurones in an area of the brain known as the orbitofrontal cortex ofc while studying macaque monkeys that had to choose between different flavours and quantities of juices they correlated the animals choices with the activity of neurones in the ofc with the valued assigned to the different types of juices some neurones would be highly active when the monkeys selected three drops of grape juice for example or drops of apple juice other neurones encoded the value of only the orange juice or grape juice the monkeys choice may be based on the activity of these neurones says padoaschioppa earlier research involving the ofc showed that lesions in the area seem to have an association with eating disorders compulsive gambling and unusual social behaviour the new findings show an association between the activity of the ofc and the mental valuation process underlying choice behaviour according to the scientists a concrete possibility is that various choice deficits may result from an impaired or dysfunctional activity of this population of neurones though this hypothesis remains to be tested says padoaschioppa theyre in here somewhere researchers have made a new kind of fabric bag that can detect its contents and alert the owner when something is missing the ladybag aimed at young professional women could put an end to leaving the house without the mobile phone house keys or wallet we are a group of six women on the team we came up with the bag idea because we thought that all of us would use it says team member ginny mesina a student from canadas simon fraser university mesina and the team developed the idea as part of a course project which placed students from the universitys interactive arts degree and the information technology degree together to design the bag the students used offtheshelf technology they embedded a radio frequency identification rfid reader which is powered by a volt battery into the bottom of the bag they then wired the reader to a screenlike panel in the front of the bag which contains three patterns of lightemitting diodes each pattern is an icon representing an essential item that the owner does not want to leave home without in the prototype these items are a set of keys a wallet and a mobile phone they then attached an rfid sensor to each of those items as long as each item is missing from the ladybag its corresponding icon lights up as the keys phone and wallet are each placed into the bag the icon blinks off i always forget my phone but always remember my handbag this is a great solution says industrial designer rosanna kilfedder a masters degree candidate at scotlands heriotwatt university in edinburgh kilfedder designed the suntrap handbag a solarpowered bag that absorbs sunlight by day and then lights up when its dark to help search for items inside i believe because people have seen how technology can make their everyday lives easier they now want more traditional products updated to offer the same benefits says kilfedder and for their younger sisters the ladybag team aims their product at something women but another version is designed to appeal to the preteen and teenager that ladybag is equipped with a lightemitting diode screen that contains seven different expressive face patterns five sensors located in different areas on the bag pick up various force and motion generated by the bags owner and then translate that into one of the seven different light patterns for example if the person fiddles frantically with the bag the face with a worried look will light up if the owner hugs the bag a happy face emoticon will light up according to mesina the team has had a wave of unexpected attention and will be talking with the universitys technology transfer department about patenting the ladybag andy roddick has the worlds fastest serve at kilometres an hour but the skys the limit researchers say physics doesnt set an upper limit for service speed you can reduce the number of stupid mistakes you make on the tennis court by applying the laws of physics a us researcher says professor howard brody of the university of pennsylvania shows knowledge of the laws of matter and motion can lift your game in one of three main ways it can cut errors of latitude hitting the ball wide depth hitting the net and force hitting the ball too hard says brody in the current issue of the british journal of sports medicine ball angle brody says you can reduce the risk of the ball going wide by not changing the angle when returning a shot changing the ball angle by attempting to return a crosscourt shot down the line or returning a downtheline shot cross court is asking for lateral problems he says but this doesnt mean you have to return the ball where it came from every time he says if a player chooses to change the ball angle the margin for error can be reduced by hitting the ball harder graphs charting ball angle relative to force show the ball leaves the racquet at a larger angle if the swing is slow brody says the statement that the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence holds for light reflecting from a plane mirror but not for tennis balls rebounding from a racquet he says clearing the net a good groundstroke needs to clear the net while landing in the right place on the other side and there is a maximum and minimal ball angle that allows this to happen using the laws of physics a good stroke will therefore have an optimum vertical angular acceptance which is maximum angle versus minimum angle brody says computer analysis shows that the harder you hit the ball the smaller the angular window of acceptance as ball speed increases from to kilometres an hour the acceptance window shrinks by the window increases as ball speed decreases in other words dont hit the ball too hard if you want to get it over the net but this leaves players in a bind should they go for a fast shot which is harder to hit but more prone to error or a slower shot which is likely to be more accurate but easier to return the player is fighting against both geometry and sir isaac newton as well as the opponent brody says brody says adding spin to a fast shot can open the angular window of acceptance because the spin acts like a downward or magnus force helping gravity pull the ball onto the court he says physics can also be applied to improving your serve and in identifying socalled sweet spots on the racquet that will achieve minimum vibration minimum shock and maximum ball rebound speed putting it into practice australian associate professor of physics rod cross of the university of sydney has written a book on the science of tennis with brody he says physics can more accurately describe what happens when a player hits a ball than the player is aware of the idea is that a physicist can tell a coach what the players supposed to be doing and why and the coach can translate that to a player he says i tried it myself i phoned up professional tennis player jelena dokic and told her she wasnt serving properly she didnt hang up straight away this composite image shows a vast cloud of hot gas red surrounding highenergy bubbles light years across blue on either side of the bright white area around the supermassive black hole black holes the monstrous mattersucking drains in space are the most fuelefficient engines in the universe researchers say just how efficient if a car could use this kind of engine it could theoretically go about billion kilometres on litres of petrol says dr steve allen an assistant professor at stanford university unfortunately no earthly car could do this as black holes are fuelled by matter lured by the holes vast gravity their pull is so strong that nothing not even light can escape most of the energy released by this matter as it gets close to the black holes point of no return or event horizon shows up in the form of highenergy jets which spew forth from magnetised discs of gas these jets speed away from the black hole at speeds up to of the speed of light which is kilometres per second and create huge bubbles in the hot cosmic gas of the galaxies these bubbles can measure hundreds or even thousands of lightyears across a lightyear is about trillion kilometres the distance light travels in a year to come up with their fuelefficiency estimate allen and his colleagues used nasas orbiting chandra xray observatory to peer into the inner regions of nine giant elliptical galaxies this view gave the scientists an idea of how much matter the black holes fuel was available other chandra observations were used to figure out how much power would be required for the jets to produce the big bubbles the scientists calculated that the energy in the jets is equivalent to about trillion trillion trillion watts the fuel reservoirs for these highefficiency black hole engines are so big the scientists say they could keep things going for hundreds of billions of years this is many times the current estimated age of the universe which is billion years how about other galaxies this fuelefficient phenomenon may be common to giant galaxies like the ones the researchers observed which are about times as massive as ours but they are probably not common to the milky way the scientists say dr kim weaver of nasas goddard space flight center says these supermassive black holes also appear to limit star formation and galactic sprawl the heat coming from the black hole jets is believed to heat up the gas around the galactic centre without this source of heat the gas would cool down and form new stars weaver says this is one way to keep the stars from forming and letting the galaxies grow bigger she says the uks mainstream power providers have caught onto wind power technology they once dismissed environmental activists are driving commercial innovation and seeding new mainstream industries a uk study says university of sussex researchers carried out the study for the uks economic and social research council the study says rather than putting up hurdles to economic progress radical activist groups and proponents of a greener lifestyle are driving developments in mainstream businesses like wind energy organic food and ecohousing activists often struggle to keep projects going and fail to produce the radical transformations they originally envisaged says author dr adrian smith this lack of breakthrough inclines them and others to underestimate the effect of their ideas but we found that although their influence is more subtle and beyond their control it is still hugely significant in many cases australian sustainability pioneer and engineering lecturer at the university of technology sydney michael mobbs says the report rings true for him the environmental lawyer was renovating his sydney home in when he decided to put in sustainable features including a water tank a reused sewage system and solar panels at the time people thought he was frothing at the mouth or somehow abnormal he says ten years later people have toured his home and he advises policy makers developers builders architects engineers and mainstream middle class australians there are now laws requiring rain tanks and many of the things i did that were regarded as weird and stupid are now in red tape he says the engineers who were once critical of me are now describing themselves as sustainability experts mobbs is currently helping western australias department for planning and infrastructure design a sustainable village at gracetown tamra lysaght is the managing director of australias national invention centre which helps innovators commercialise their ideas australia may be lagging behind europe in taking up the ideas of fringe groups because she says australias environmental problems arent as pressing and theres less government support for sustainable projects she says while the centre doesnt usually deal directly with activists aspiring inventors often put an environmental spin their product as a selling point lysaght says no one single group can be credited with driving change and a move to more sustainable industries is a response to a network of social and economic factors she also says environmental activist groups can sometimes be an impediment to the development of potentially beneficial technologies such as nuclear power the environmental movement has certainly been a key player in curtailing the nuclear power industry in australia and globally she says but whether you view that as good or bad depends on which side of the fence youre sitting on the report supporting and harnessing diversity experiments in appropriate technology can be downloaded from the research councils website leo the lion and his other signs of the zodiac dont define your personality a new study shows one of the largest studies of the possible link between human traits and astrology has found little if any connection between the traditional sun signs of the zodiac and peoples characteristics the study adds to the growing body of evidence that there is no scientific basis for star signs like aries and taurus signs that are based on the place of the sun in relation to someones date of birth but the researchers leave open the question as to whether other more detailed and personal forms of astrology hold any validity when considering the current scientific standing with respect to sun signs it becomes clear that there is little or no truth in them says dr peter hartmann who led the study in the may issue of the journal personality and individual differences this does not necessarily mean that all astrology is without truth but only that the independent effect of sun signs is most likely to be irrelevant says hartmann a researcher in the department of psychology at denmarks university of aarhus as for the weekly horoscope based on mere sun signs then according to the current scientific standing there is probably more truth in the comic strips hartmann and his colleagues used computer analysis and statistical methods to study possible astrological connections between over individuals their test subjects came from two sources the first was the vietnam experience study which gathered information about intelligence personality and date of birth for male military veterans the second was the national longitudinal study of youth which included intelligence and date of birth information for males and females aged between and years if connections existed over a rate of they were considered valid and not the result of random links no link in vietnam the scientists could find no relationship between the time and date of a persons birth and their personality traits which the vietnam study categorised using terms such as psychoticism extraversion neuroticism and social desirability the researchers however did determine that individuals from the vietnam test who were born between the months of july and december were slightly more intelligent by less than one iq point than those who were born between january to june that finding was reversed for the youth study in that case people who were born january to june had the minute intellectual edge and in the real world hartmann says that although the information about intelligence passed the nonrandom restriction he views the connection as irrelevant assuming that you could buy a pill that would increase your iq with one point but it would cost you would you do it probably not but if you could buy a pill that would increase your iq by points that would be something else simply because you get more value for your money he says the essence here is that there is a difference in determining whether a result is significant hence whether it is a true effect or just random occurrence and then whether this significant effect is relevant and of any interest the australian connection geoffrey dean a former astrologist based in australia who researches the possible scientific validity of astrology tracked over people who were born within minutes of each other the study which spanned several decades covered over different characteristics like marital status iq anxiety and temperament was published in in the journal of consciousness studies dean came to a similar conclusion as hartmann and his team that date of birth does not affect an individuals personality theres no motivation to put up arabic content on the web as theres no dedicated search engine to find it commentators say but that may be about to change with the launch of a new search engine later this year plans for a dedicated arabic language search engine could boost the number of arabic webpages its developers say the saudigerman search engine called sawafi is planned to be launched in the last quarter of and it could set a tough challenge for international search giants such as google msn and yahoo which currently offer a basic arabic search there is no full arabic internet search engine on the market you find socalled search engines but they involve a directory search not a local search says hermann havermann managing director of german internet tech firm seekport sawafi working with saudi partner integrated technical solutions is hoping to copy the success of local chinese language search engine baidu which has made huge strides in a market with over million users everything is to play for in the arabic speaking world of million people where internet penetration is low there are also large communities arabic speakers internationally there are only million webpages right now in arabic and thats nothing its only of the total worldwide havermann says research commissioned from dubaibased internet researcher madar shows the number of arabic speaking internet users could jump to million in from million in havermann says according to madar of arabic internet users in could not read english which accounts for of the material on the internet better search engines are key to a turnaround there is not enough arabic content available on the internet but theres no motivation to put more arabic content on the internet as long as you dont have a system to find the content havermann says saudi arabia with an affluent population of million and dubai in the united arab emirates would be key places for winning online advertising to fuel arabic search engines search engines are dependent on income from advertising and for this you need partners and marketing agencies they are in dubai havermann says on the other side the arabic user market is in saudi arabia microbiologists have found the bacteria resonsible for preparing fartfree beans beans cooked with a pinch of bacteria means diners can tuck in without the explosive results scientists say researchers from venezuela say two strains of bacteria are the key to producing fartfree beans they show how lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus plantarum can be added to beans so they cause minimal distress to those who eat them and to those around them marisela granito of simon bolivar university in caracas and colleagues report their results in the journal of the science of food and agriculture flatulence is caused by bacteria that live in the large intestine that break down food not already digested higher in the gut the gas the bacteria produce is emitted from the body as a fart granito and colleagues found that adding these two gut bacteria to black beans or phaseolus vulgaris before cooking makes them even less likely to cause flatulence legumes and particularly phaseolus vulgaris are an important source of nutrients especially in developing countries granitos team writes in spite of being part of the staple diets of these populations their consumption is limited by the flatulence they produce smart cooks know they can ferment beans and make them less gasinducing by cooking them in the juices from a previous batch but granitos team wanted to find out just which bacteria were responsible cooking up a storm when the researchers fermented black beans with the two bacteria they found it decreased the soluble fibre content by more than and lowered levels of raffinose a compound known to cause gas by they fed the beans to rats and then analysed the rats droppings to ensure that the beans were digested and kept their nutritional value when presoaked in l casei the beans stayed nutritious and produced few gascausing compounds the researchers report therefore the lactic acid bacteria involved in the bean fermentation which include l casei as a probiotic could be used as functional starter cultures in the food industry the researchers write likewise the cooking applied after induced fermentation produced an additional diminution of the compounds related to flatulence space explorers have been urged to consider the implications of exploring the cosmos before taking another leap for mankind we will need an intergalactic police force to keep order in space and protect the interests of the vulnerable says a us ethicist dr patrick lin of the the nanoethics group in santa barbara california says we should be thinking about the ethical implications of future space exploration and some kind of government or police force should be considered he will tell the international space development conference in los angeles next week that it is not clear that an earthbased government would be the most effective space has been long called the final frontier but have we taken the time to consider what our responsibilities are as frontiersmen says lin lins recommendations are part of a call for space explorers to look before taking another leap for mankind commercial space travel is becoming a reality he says and the public needs confidence that governments scientists and astronauts are considering the consequences of exploring space for instance lin says we need a fair process for commercialising or claiming property in space to avoid what he calls the kind of chaotic landgrab that occurred with internet domain names we would not rush to develop the south pole without a wellthought plan so the same reasonable precaution would seem to apply to colonising space he says there he says there are legal disputes already despite un treaties declaring space as commonlyowned he says lawsuits have been filed to lay claim to asteroids why are we doing it anyway lin says it is important to have a justifiable reason for exploring space are reasons such as for adventure wanderlust or backing up the biosphere good enough to justify our exploration of space he says we should question the idea that space may provide an escape for us if our world becomes overpopulated and uninhabitable does having a safety net such as a backup planet make it more likely that we take more chances and treat our current planet less carefully lin says issues such as polluting space the proliferation of military technologies in space and the safety of space travellers should also be considered we have already littered our outer atmosphere with floating space debris that rockets and satellites need to track and navigate around not to mention abandoned equipment on the moon and other planets he says have we learned enough about ourselves and our history to avoid the same mistakes as we have made on earth finally says lin some critics suggest it may be better to spend money on alleviating poverty and hunger providing access to clean and affordable water and energy and addressing other issues including human rights violations plenty of real estate in space australian cosmologist and space exploration advocate professor paul davies agrees space exploration is a free for all but doesnt think regulation is needed he says he supports the views of us physicist and futurologist emeritus professor freeman dyson of the institute of advanced studies in princeton who sees space as an escape from the straightjacket of an overregulated earth we could find whole new ways of organising society says davies of the australian centre for astrobiology at macquarie university in sydney davies says space is not finite in the same way earth is which means there is less need to control development there in a sense space is unlimited he says theres a lot of real estate out there and no possibility i think within a thousand years of any sort of territorial conflict but davies believes we should be regulating exploration of mars if we find life there to ensure scientists can study it he also says we need to take the issues of space junk and militarisation of space seriously but he does not think its fair to say money spent on space exploration should be spent on solving problems on earth lets stop sport and spend that money on alleviating poverty in africa he says you never hear that argument gravity and not colliding space rocks made neptune and the other giant planets tilt according to a new hypothesis an early gravitational dance made the giant planets tilt an astronomer suggests the shift probably happened billions of years ago when the bigger planets in our solar system were closer together than they are now and the gravity of each one pulled on the others writes argentinian researcher dr adrian brunini today in the journal nature this neutral gravitational interaction caused jupiter saturn uranus and neptune to have tilted axes that were determined as they moved through the solar system to take their current positions far from the sun says brunini from the facultad de ciencias astronomicas y geofisicas in buenos aires this is a departure from an earlier theory that holds that the massive planets tilts or obliquities were caused by collisions with earthsized space rocks during the early period of the solar system this model has some problems that were not clear how to solve brunini says for example we believe that such a big object never existed in the outer solar system gravity on gravity brunini used numerical models to show that the outer planets obliquities could have been created by gravitational interactions all the planets in our solar system have tilted axes but the bigger ones have axes that lean at a constant angle while the smaller ones like earth have obliquities that can change despite the potential for change earths axis has been leaning at about deg for millions of years and is almost completely stabilised by the moons gravitational pull brunini says but mars axis might change over tens of millions of years earths tilt stable but crucial for humans the reliability of earths tilted axis is important as it is responsible for the change of seasons at the point in its annual orbit where earths northern hemisphere leans away from the sun its winter when the southern hemisphere tilts away its winter south of the equator while the more massive planets have stable obliquities they range in size from a nearly perpendicular deg for jupiter to about deg for uranus brunini says it took an average of to months for men to regain their fertility after stopping the pill but some men had to wait as long as years worries that the male contraceptive pill may wreck a mans chance of fathering a child are unfounded says a new study men given a hormonebased contraceptive can regain their fertility about four months after stopping the treatment researchers report today in the lancet journal drug companies have been working on a male pill or injection to inhibit sperm production and give couples a greater choice of family planning methods the three main male contraceptive methods the condom withdrawal and vasectomy are regarded by many as insufficiently reliable or difficult to reverse the male pill uses the hormone androgen or a mixture of androgen and progestogen to suppress sperm production to zero or negligible levels us and australian scientists analysed studies involving men who had been given the contraceptives in trials and found the treatments were highly effective but reversible hormonal male contraceptive methods could soon become widely available says dr peter liu currently at the anzac research institute at the university of sydney these findings thereby increase the promise of new contraceptive drugs allowing men to share more fairly the satisfaction and burden of family planning largescale trials of male hormonebased contraceptives are being conducted in china and europe the scientists say liu and his team analysed data on men who had taken part in trials that had been published between and all participants recovered fertility after they stopped taking the hormones on average it took months to achieve this defined as a threshold of million sperm per millilitre but some men took as long as two years to regain their fertility the researchers say various factors including age original sperm count duration of treatment and ethnic origin could influence the recovery rate two of the study authors are employed by pharmaceutical companies the researchers compared the dna from different types of banksia and other woody plants around the world tropical plants evolve twice as quickly as their cousins from more temperate regions researchers say that could provide the answer to one of the most puzzling questions about evolution why there are so many more species in tropical regions than there are in temperate zones a new zealand study published online today in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences measured the rate of change that had occurred over millions of years in the dna of closely paired species of woody plants for each pair we used two closely related species one from the tropics and one from a temperate zone says coauthor dr len gillman from auckland university of technology the study compared plants included conifers kauri pine grevilleas and wattle from tropical areas of australia papua new guinea and the amazon with their counterparts in temperate zones in countries including new zealand the us and australias island state of tasmania by sequencing a particular region of dna in each pair and comparing it to the same region in an equivalent common ancestor the team were able to measure the rate of evolutionary change we found that there was double the molecular change in the tropical species says gillman if youve got twice the rate of evolution occurring youve got twice the opportunity for species to be generated and accumulate over time the study suggests that the faster rate of evolutionary change in tropical plants is due to higher metabolic and productivity rates a higher metabolic rate leads to more cell division and increases the opportunities for mutation although it was suspected that more energy was responsible for the greater species diversity towards the equator the new zealand team is the first to demonstrate a mechanism a faster rate of evolution the researchers say that this is unlikely to be caused by rapid genetic drift in the generally smaller populations of plants in the speciesrich tropics though it warrants further investigation they suggest that the greater rate of speciation seen in the tropics is a consequence rather than a cause of the faster rate of molecular evolution people have until may to have their say in australias national nanotechnology strategy the australian public is being left out of crucial decisions on nanotechnology that will affect their future health environmental social and economic wellbeing says an environmental group the friends of the earth foe says the government taskforce charged with developing a national nanotechnology plan is treating public input as a tokenistic addon rather than something that should help shape australias response to the technology the government has given the public the month of april to make submissions to its nanotechnology strategy but foe says this is not enough public awareness of nanotechnology is so low that this is a really inappropriate way for the taskforce to be seeking public involvement says georgia miller of foes nanotechnology project foe wants a public education campaign on nanotechnology public meetings and consensus conferences or other processes to involve a broader range of the public miller says the process should be independently funded and run by a steering group of representatives from all parts of society likely to be affected by nanotechnology this isnt a radical suggestion she says this is something along the lines of what the uk government has already set up to oversee its public engagement process on nanotechnology miller says unions environmental public health farming disability rights consumer and civil liberties groups should be involved in developing the strategy but she says the taskforce has had only ad hoc contact with groups other than those from science and industry discussion paper lacking the national nanotechnology strategy taskforce the body within the federal industry department charged with developing australias nanotechnology plan issued a discussion paper for public comment but miller says this discussion paper trivialises the potential risks of nanotechnology which she says is already widely used unlabelled and untested in commercial products she says bodies like the uk royal society have recommended nanomaterials be assessed as new products but the paper makes no mention of legislation to manage any risks miller also says the paper should have mentioned efforts by researchers to enhance humans by combining nanotechnology with biotechnology information technology and cognitive science and she says it should have recognised the economic impact of nanomaterials carbon nanofibres may displace cotton but this isnt even mentioned and this would have huge impacts for australia she says extensive consultation david gallagher general manager of the national nanotechnology strategy taskforce says surveys show there is a low level of public knowledge about nanotechnology but that is not surprising he agrees the discussion document is limited for example on health and safety issues but says it was only designed to be a starting point for public comment the point of the public process is to determine if people believe health and safety is an issue and if it is why he says a spokesperson for industry minister ian macfarlane says the taskforce is undertaking extensive consultation with industry science and community groups to develop the strategy the government recognises that public engagement is not a one off process the spokesperson says it is likely that options for a national nanotechnology strategy will place priority on the need for ongoing effective public engagement awareness and debate much in the same way as has been done with biotechnology balancing act nanomaterials researcher professor chennupati jagadish who convenes of the australian research council nanotechnology network and has also advised the taskforce says public engagement is absolutely essential but he says its a balancing act because australia needs the national strategy so it can be competitive internationally time is also of the essence says jagadish who is based at the australian national university in canberra australian council of trade unions occupational health and safety officer steve mullins says he sees the strategy discussion paper as the beginning of the process to raise public awareness about nanotechnology not the end there is a very real risk that environmental and health and safety concerns will be sidelined by government and business in their enthusiasm to develop the industry in australia he says the taskforce is due to report to the minister in june controversy over gm crops continue but a new report recommends no changes to the law calls for changes to the laws governing gene technology in australia have been largely rejected in a new report despite ongoing controversy over genetically modified crops a review of the gene technology act by a governmentappointed review panel found there should only be minor changes to the act which it outlines in a report released this week the review also calls for states to end their moratoria on genetically modified gm crops it was the issue that was raised at every forum it was the hot issue says review panel chair environmental lawyer susan timbs the review rejects calls for the act to be changed so that economic social and marketing impacts of gm crops could be considered and it agrees with gm researchers and industry that gm and nongm crops can coexist the review also disagrees with some farming and consumer groups that people releasing gm organisms gmos be made strictly liable for any detrimental effects of their products more time to assess risky applications but the review recommends some changes in the way the office of the gene technology regulator ogtr assesses applications for the release of gmos the review recommends the regulator be given more time to assess applications for the commercial release of organisms deemed to be of significant risk timbs says under the proposal this would provide more time for public consultation but the time limit for assessing field trials would be reduced and industry and researchers conducting low risk work with gmos would have less requirement to report their activities timbs says the review also recommends the gene technology technical advisory committee gttac which advises the ogtr on risks should include people with specific expertise in public health and environmental risk assessment responses senator natasha stott despoja australian democrats spokesperson on science and biotechnology says the review makes few recommendations to improve the system the report found a high level of transparency in relation to the regulatory system which appears to be contradicted by the lack of information made available to the public on gm trials by the office of the gene technology regulator she says the report also found the states moratoria on gm crops to have detrimental rather than beneficial impacts on markets given the evidence of gm contamination of nongm crops and the lack of research into the impact of human consumption of gm products the states are showing an appropriate level of caution in regard to this technology professor sue serjeantson of the australian academy of science says the act has provided a climate of community confidence about gmo assessment but she says the moratoria are a disincentive for research and means the act has failed to capture the benefits of biotechnology for the australian community industry and the environment she says the moratoria may not be in place if the community had access to quality information about biotechnology the potential risks and benefits of its application this highlights the necessity for the ogtr to be involved in increasing public awareness of gm technology to assist the regulator applying the act nasa engineers have made minor tweaks to the design of discoverys external fuel tank but they are waiting until after the next launch to redesign small foam wedges of insulation the us space agency says it will not make any more changes to the design of the shuttles fuel tank until after the next flight despite ongoing concerns about foam insulation breaking off and damaging the shuttle during launch nasas shuttle program manager wayne hale acknowledged a slight risk that a small chunk of foam could break off from a newly exposed part of the external fuel tank and critically damage discoverys heat shield during its proposed july launch the insulation prevents ice from building up and breaking off during launch shuttle columbia and its crew of seven astronauts were lost during atmospheric reentry in february due to wing damage from a piece of foam insulation that fell off and hit the shuttle during launch the tank was redesigned but foam from another part of the tank was lost during the first postcolumbia launch of discovery last july engineers then removed two aerodynamic ramps of foam that had protected a box of cables and two pressurisation lines from the tremendous winds and turbulence created by the shuttles supersonic climb to orbit hale says the ramps removal was the largest aerodynamic change that we have made since the shuttle first flew tests to determine if the new design is safe to fly remain under way after much debate hale decided making more than a major change in the tanks design was riskier than the slight chance of a critical impact by the small foam wedges those chunks cover metal brackets that attach the cable tray and pressurisation lines to the outside of the tank we had to ask whether its appropriate to make more than one change to the outer shell of the vehicle hale says if we go fly and have another accident that will be the end of the program upon discoverys safe return engineers will redesign the small foam wedges hale adds nasa wants to fly the shuttle another or more times to complete construction of the international space station and possibly service the hubble space telescope before the fleet is retired in managers expect to make a decision about whether the shuttles redesigned tank is safe to fly at a review scheduled for midjune nasas next opportunity to fly a shuttle to the space station under its postcolumbia safety protocols which include a daylight launch is july youre more open to suggestion with a cup of coffee in your hand research shows if you want to bring someone around to your way of thinking you should make sure theyve got a cup of coffee in their hand according to research showing that caffeine makes us more open to persuasion the australian researchers say a caffeine hit improves our ability to process information and increases the extent to which we listen to and take on board a persuasive message they tested this by quizzing people about their attitudes to voluntary euthanasia and abortion before and after either the equivalent of about two cups of coffee or a placebo they were also given a persuasive argument to read after having the caffeine the experiments showed that caffeine increases persuasion through instigating systematic processing of the message but caffeine also puts people in a better mood which makes them more likely to agree with a message the researchers say the research is posted on the queensland university of technology website and is submitted for publication in the european journal of social psychology what does this mean for advertising coauthor dr blake mckimmie says the research suggests that caffeine increases our ability to scrutinise the content of a message the study has implications for advertisers he says because it suggests that they should schedule adverts for times when people are likely to be consuming caffeine such as breakfast time drinking too much coffee however means were more likely to be distracted by peripheral factors rather than the strength of the argument so if youre looking at an advertisement you may be more distracted by the attractiveness of the person selling it than the actual product he says caffeine on the brain associate professor pradeep nathan of monash university an expert in behavioural neuroscience who was not involved in the research says caffeine stimulates the central nervous system including the brain where it affects several neurotransmitters the melbournebased researcher says it improves memory and makes us pay closer attention to tasks at hand it does improve attention and it can improve memory so by being more attentive and remembering your attitude to a particular thing may change he says if youre more attentive yes it does have implications for advertising advertising works on the principle of getting peoples attention you want to get as many people interested in your ads as possible but will it last geoff kelly is the chief executive officer of an australian consultancy that advises governments and corporations on how to get people to buy a particular message he says there are different levels of persuasion and the key to success lies in whether the persuasion is long term many things can be instrumental in persuasion but will they last in the long term he says if i have the magical technique to take you out to dinner it might work but it doesnt mean i can get you to go out with me resting your forearms on a soft support as you type seems to reduce your chance of pain in the neck shoulders arm wrist or hand office workers who use a simple forearm support might avoid the pain that can come with long days at the computer new research suggests in a yearlong study of workers at a call centre researchers found that those who received forearm supports for their desks were less likely to suffer pain in the neck shoulders arm wrist or hand they were also less likely to be diagnosed with a musculoskeletal injury in the neck or shoulders according to findings published in the latest issue of the journal occupational and environmental medicine the forearm support used in the study was a padded board that attaches to the front edge of workers desks the support is placed right under the meaty part of the forearm positioning computer users arms in a way that releases tension in the shoulder muscles says lead author professor david rempel from the university of california san francisco based on these findings employers should consider providing forearm supports to workers who spend substantial time in front of a computer rempel says the results were less positive though for a trackball a large ball installed next to the computer keyboard that takes the place of the mouse while it did ease some workers discomfort others found it hard to use rempel says the study included employees at a large insurers call centre all of whom spend their workday at a computer some workers received a forearm support for their desks while others received a trackball all employees were also given ergonomics training so they could learn how to make their entire workstation more comfortable over the next year rempels team found workers who used a forearm support were half as likely as those who received only ergonomics training to be diagnosed with a neck or shoulder injury they also reported less pain in the neck shoulders and right arm the cost of forearm supports is not negligible rempel says but in a cost analysis he and his colleagues found that the supports could be a worthwhile investment considering the potential savings in medical and workers compensation expenses they would pay for themselves in about months rempel says but forearm supports alone are not sufficient according to the researchers rempel says all employees should receive proper safety and ergonomics training to reduce their chances of onthejob injuries be careful what you write in your blog the boss could be watching bosses are considering putting specific provisions in employment contracts that could regulate what you put in your private blog or even prevent you from blogging at all according to a new book a chapter on blogging and the law written by two australian experts says such clauses could stop employees from referring to their workplace even when they are writing personal blogs from their own home employers are now considering including specific blogging provisions in employment contracts the authors write in uses of blogs a book to be published later this year some employers have even taken the steps to ensure that employment contracts disallow employees from blogging at all coauthor damien obrien from the queensland university of technology law faculty says some workplaces have specific policies against blogging in the office but it can get a bit blurred whether its in the workplace or at home certainly some of the provisions that would be put in contracts would cover when people are blogging outside their work he says the trend comes after a recent spate of cases in which employees have run into trouble over personal blogs including a us flight attendant who was sacked for allegedly posting images of herself in uniform the practice of sacking people because of their blog has even got a name doocing after a us woman who was allegedly dismissed for writing satirical accounts of her workplace in her private blog at doocecom changing technology stephen price is the workplace relations practice leader at the australian law firm corrs chambers and westgarth and advises a number of large corporations on workplace issues he says concerns about blogging are related to issues like disclosure of confidential information or defamation of bosses clients or colleagues which originally focused on email as technology has moved on that concern has highlighted new areas and one of those new areas is blogging he says price says none of his clients has attempted to restrict employees blogging and he isnt aware of a blogrelated case coming before an australian court but in the future it wouldnt surprise me he says its pretty hard to draw up a contract that says you cant blog at home privately and have that upheld unless the person was distributing confidential information or defaming or harassing somebody which would be covered by other provisions of the contract making policy clear professor brian fitzgerald head of law at queensland university of technology and a coauthor of the chapter on blogging and the law says as a socalled disruptive technology all parties may have to adapt to the fact that blogging is here to stay yes the law will need to adapt yes bloggers will need to adapt but also the big players will have to adapt he says the blogging issue is a bit like accessing websites every workplace needs a protocol uses of blogs to be published by the peter lang publishing group in new york is due for international release this year imaginary playmates are a sign of a rich fantasy life but can also hint at problems researchers say children with imaginary friends have more vivid daydreams than other children a new study shows for the first time australian researcher dr paula bouldin of deakin university shows that children with imaginary friends also tend to have more mythical content in their dreams they spend more time daydreaming and have an ability to almost see and hear the contents of their daydream in front of them it may appear obvious that children with imaginary friends have a richer fantasy life than those without but to date there has been little specific research into the area bouldin says her work reported in the journal of genetic psychology finally provides evidence of this she questioned children aged between three and eight half with a current or past imaginary friend the group with imaginary friends reported more mythical content in their dreams had more frequent and more vivid daydreams and were more likely to play games with a mythical content when imaginary friends turn nasty dr louise newman a child psychiatrist and the director of the new south wales institute of psychiatry says the study confirms what has long been suspected but she says further research needs to look at the psychological and emotional function of imaginary friends newman says while some imaginary friends function as sort of super peers or the perfect playmate they can also be a sign of emotional disturbance there are some cases in which children have those companions because they might be lonely distressed or unable to put into words things that are concerning them she says some friends can be quite persecutory or frightening they might torment the child or express doubts tell them theyre stupid or bad newman says while imaginary friends are quite common in younger ages they are more likely to be associated with emotional or family problems in children over the age of about seven adults with imaginary friends most children grow out of imaginary friends newman says but in some cases an imaginary friend can emerge in adulthood usually in response to trauma inability to cope with stress and sometimes psychotic illness in rare cases some adults develop whats known as doppelganger syndrome which occurs when they believe a twin or invisible friend accompanies them other people believe in angels and guardian angels and they dont think theres anything out of the ordinary about that she says bouldin says her study suggests children with imaginary friends can readily access fantasy themes and may develop sophisticated information processing skills but she says it could also be that children with imaginary friends are simply more willing to discuss their fantasies than those without genetically modified viruses that line up and conduct electricity could be the basis of a new generation of batteries genetically manipulated viruses could replace standard lithiumion batteries packing two to three times more energy than other batteries researchers say the virus batteries could be thin transparent and lightweight according to a us study published online recently in the journal science by professor angela belcher of the massachusetts institute of technology and team because less material is devoted to packaging more of the battery is used just for generating power what were trying to do is have all of the mass and volume be used for the purpose it is to be used for which is to power the device says belcher the researchers say such a battery should last as long as conventional batteries and it could power anything from microelectronics including chemical and biological sensors lab on chip devices and security tags to larger items such as mobile phones computer displays and even electric cars building batteries like building anything requires assembly the smaller the battery the more challenging that is current manufacturing techniques involve arranging nanoparticles nanotubes or nanowires on surfaces using expensive hightemperature methods belcher and her team decided to capitalise on biologys inherent knack for organising microscopic structures and apply it to battery technology viruses acting like wires to make the viruses work like conducting wires the scientists genetically altered the organisms so that proteins on their surfaces would be attracted to metal particles including cobalt and gold four different solutions went into the battery component a negatively charged polymer a positively charged polymer negatively charged viruses and charged particles or ions of cobalt the scientists spread the negatively and positively charged polymer solutions onto a glass slide in alternating layers next they dipped the slide into a solution containing millions of the altered viruses the wirelike viruses automatically spread themselves evenly across the slide as they have a natural tendency to slightly repel each other when the slide was dipped into the ion solution proteins on the surface of the viruses attracted the metal ions causing the organisms to become essentially conducting wires and because viruses naturally replicate scientists say that growing more to make many batteries shouldnt be hard all you do is grow them in a bigger fermenter and youre done once you do theres no roadblock to scale up to industrial level production says brent iverson professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the university of texas at austin building anodes and cathodes when the polymer solution dries it becomes a transparent anode the batterys positively charged terminal a piece of film about centimetres by centimetres contains about a billion conducting viruses belcher and her team are working next to produce the negatively charged cathode with the viruses and believe they will have a working prototype in about two years melting ice is depriving polar bears of their habitat says a new report making them a vulnerable species polar bears and hippos have joined the ranks of species threatened with extinction from climate change unregulated hunting and other humanmade dangers says a leading environmental agency the world conservation union or iucn says more than species of animals and plants are at risk of disappearing including one in four mammals and one in eight birds it added species to its red list of endangered species since the last version released two years ago australia china brazil and mexico are home to large numbers of threatened species says the iucn its members include governments more than nongovernmental groups and some scientists from around the world the agency says countries worldwide need to boost efforts to preserve biodiversity through reduced emissions tighter fishing and hunting controls and other measures without a reversal of global warming trends it predicts polar bear populations would drop more than in the next years as melted ice caps deprive the animals of their habitat it classifies the polar bear as a vulnerable species one step down from endangered in its ranking of extinction risk the polar bear was previously called a lesssevere conservation dependent species the common hippo was also ranked as vulnerable primarily because of a catastrophic decline in the democratic republic of congo the iucn says unrestricted hunting has caused a decline in the central african countrys hippo population since it says the animal has never before been listed as threatened critically endangered dama gazelles once the most populous species of gazelle in the sahara desert are now critically endangered as a result of poaching the report finds more than half of the mediterraneans endemic species of freshwater fish are deemed to be at risk of extinction along with one in four of east africas freshwater fish in malawi where freshwater fish account for of the animal protein that humans eat the numbers of lake trout in lake malawi have halved in the past decade this could have major commercial and dietary consequences for the region the iucn says ocean life is also cited as vulnerable of species of sharks and rays assessed in the report are found to be at risk of extinction bottomdwelling species also logged huge declines as fisheries have reached into everdeeper waters populations are destined to decline in the absence of international catch limits the report says adding regulations on mesh size and nonfishing areas could help restore stocks conservation can work world conservation union director general achim steiner says resurgent populations of whitetailed eagles in europe shows that protective measures can protect vulnerable species conservation measures are making a difference steiner says for example on australias christmas island the seabird abbotts booby was declining due to habitat clearance and was listed as critically endangered in but the booby is recovering thanks to conservation measures and has now moved down a category to endangered the iucn says scientists say that terrestrial gammaray flashes could spark cloudtocloud lightning the ongoing hunt for the sources of exotic gamma rays inside earths atmosphere has taken two strange turns one is that the powerful radiation flashes are being triggered far closer to the ground than ever suspected the other is that in at least one case a burst of gamma rays appears to have happened before a burst of cloudtocloud lightning like a lightning trigger terrestrial gammaray flashes are thought to occur when electrons that have been somehow sped to near lightspeed slam into air molecules the great burst of energy the collision releases is enough to create gamma rays one of the most powerful form of electromagnetic radiation researchers have thought they were in some way associated with sprites the enigmatic vertical bolts of lighting that zap upward from very high cloud tops towards space but new us research with an array of groundbased and spaceborne instruments has located the gammaray sources much deeper in the earths atmosphere in thunderstorms the finding reported recently in the journal geophysical research letters is puzzling because the thicker air of the lower atmosphere gobbles up gamma rays pretty quickly sprites were the logical choice for a link with gammaray flashes says lead author dr mark stanley of the los alamos national laboratory not only are they flashy and energetic they are also close to the edge of space which would easily allow the gamma rays to escape the atmosphere and reach orbiting detectors but theres nothing there and thats quite a shock says stanley high flashes and low ones the researchers took new measurements using the groundbased los alamos sferic array which detects electrical changes in the atmosphere and the gammaray detector onboard the orbiting ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager their results indicate the terrestrial gammaray flashes are coming from much lower down and come from cloudtocloud lighting in much thicker gammaray absorbing air that means the exact source of the gamma rays has to be putting out a lot more gamma rays so a few can make it up into space and be detected if you detect this at any distance that means whatever causes this is incredibly violent says stanley stanley and his colleagues have found terrestrial gammaray flashes that appear to come from less than metres up within the range of jet aircraft im getting some even lower than that stanley says perhaps terrestrial gamma ray flashes are created at various elevations says lightning researcher assistant professor steven cummer of duke university those that are higher can be only detected by the orbiting imager and those that are lower can be detected only on the ground which came first the gamma rays or the lightning stanley and his colleagues also refined the timing of the events and in one case found that the gamma rays detected by the orbiting imager might have preceded the lightning which was a complete surprise he says in every way this was unusual says stanley until now it had been assumed that the terrestrial gammaray flashes were a product of the lightning initiation process now it also appears possible that they could also play a role in triggering lightning how its really not at all that well understood says cummer despite centuries of research to unlock the secrets of lighting including benjamin franklins discovery of its electrical nature cummer says nobody really knows what starts a lightning strike male praying mantises have one of two types of genitalia say researchers the first time anyone has seen this type of dimorphism in insects some praying mantises have genitalia that hang to the left and others to the right says a behavioural ecologist but greg holwell an australian postdoctoral researcher at macquarie university says he doesnt know why holwell reported this unusual trait at the recent australasian association for the study of animal behaviour conference in sydney holwell travelled to queensland hoping to study sexual cannibalism in praying mantises or mantids but he got more than he bargained for rather than finding examples of females eating males he found a unique case of dimorphism where there are two distinct forms of a particular species he found the males of the species ciulfina are identical except they have genitalia that are the mirror image of each another their genitalia point in one direction or the other which is a very unusual phenomenon says howell he knows they are both the same species because hes mated left and righthanded males with females and theyve produced offspring that have survived dna studies also show they are the same species this is really a big thing he says a rare find dimorphism is quite common for example males and females of the same species but it is extremely rare within a particular sex says holwell whats even rarer is dimorphism in genitalia he says this is why so many species distinctions particularly in insects normally rely on differences in genitalia holwell says there are only two other known cases of dimorphism in genitalia one involving female spiders and other involving male thrips but the mantids are the first to show mirrorimage genitalia it may just be a genetic mutation thats occurred at some point and because left and righthanded males dont have any particular advantage over another both forms have survived in the population he says the male mantids genitals consist of a number of components that enable the male to stimulate the female attach to her and transfer packets of sperm called spermatophores the females are perfectly symmetrical says holwell which means asymmetrical males must twist their abdomen to mate with the females the direction of the twist depends on which way they hang more strange behaviour holwells colleagues have also found that when males transfer a sperm packet to females some of it is inserted into the female and some is left hanging out some time after mating the female does a kind of a yoga twist pulls her abdomen up to her face pulls the spermatophore out and eats it says holwell the researchers want to find out whether the female eats empty sperm packets which means she is just tidying up but holwell says if she removes packets still containing sperm this might be her way of controlling which male gets to fertilise her comatose patients lose their muscle tone have feeding tubes and often open their eyes hardly the stuff of movies portraying coma patients in movies as sleeping beauties misrepresents reality and could skew the way we think and deal with coma in real life researchers report they say showing people suddenly awakening after years in a coma with no physical or mental problems or depicting longterm comatose patients peacefully sleeping with perfect grooming and a healthy tan minus any feeding tubes or loss of muscle tone is unrealistic the concern is that these images become real for everyday people and may well influence the decisions they would make if faced with a similar situation researchers report in the journal neurology dr eelco wijdicks a fellow of the american academy of neurology reviewed movies from around the world that depict prolonged coma and found that only two characters showed a reasonably accurate representation wijdicks and colleague then showed clips of scenes from some of the movies to people with no medical training more than a third couldnt identify important inaccuracies in the scenes for example shown a comedy scene where a comatose person tapped out a message with his finger in morse code believe it could happen in real life and of those surveyed say they would allow the scenes to influence decisions they make if a family member is in the same situation australian consultant neurologist associate professor richard burns who is based at flinders university and repatriation general hospital in adelaide says he takes movie scenes of comatose patients with a pinch of salt there is this rare instance where someone does recover from prolonged coma and does seem to be all right but that would be one in or even more but it does make it difficult when you are explaining to relatives that there is no hope he says burns says he cant remember a person in a prolonged coma just suddenly waking up he believes movie makers have a responsibility to depict coma accurately but its unrealistic to expect them to do it because they like to show the exceptional eggplants and other ingredients of ratatouille become more acidic if you roast them in the oven cooked vegetables can be as acidic as tootheroding fizzy drinks scientists warn eggplants green capsicum and zucchini become more acidic when roasted in the oven while red capsicum becomes heavily acidic when stewed according to a study at scotlands university of dundee but the acidity of onions or tomatoes does not change with the cooking method dr graham chadwick publishes his findings in the current issue of the european journal of prosthodontics and restorative dentistry the researchers study was prompted by reports that people on a vegetarian diet may be at risk of dental erosion this is because the large quantity of foods that they eat such as fruit and vegetables tend to be quite acidic so the researchers studied how different methods of cooking a vegetarian dish like ratatouille could affect its acidity ratatouille was acidic no matter how it was cooked but ovenroasting significantly increased the acidity of the dish compared with stewing the acidity of ratatouille prepared by ovenroasting is the same as that of some carbonated drinks that when consumed in excess are believed to contribute to the development of dental erosion says chadwick acid can etch into the thin layer of enamel that protects the teeth and can also affect the underlying dentin earlier this year researchers presented research into the corrosive potential of acidic drinks at the american association for dental research annual meeting in florida the university of iowa researchers found that drinks including fizzy drinks and apple juice can erode exposed root surfaces saturns gassy nature makes its difficult for scientists to see the length of a day saturn is spinning slower than expected scientists report an international team of researchers has calculated the rotation period is hours and minutes thats minutes longer than estimates from the nasa voyager results in the early s it may not sound like a lot but the researchers say it could affect how we calculate the size of the planets rock and ice core and provide more insights into how it formed the team publishes its results today in the journal nature making this measurement has been one of the teams most important scientific goals says professor michele dougherty of imperial college london astronomers have long tried to calculate the length of a saturn day william herschel back in the late th century for example suggested it lasted about hours but the nature of saturn itself makes measurements difficult unlike earth which has a rocky surface saturn is made up mostly of hydrogen and helium gases which complicates how scientists measure the length of a day so rather than take direct measurements scientists use proxies or markers of the planets rotational period in the s scientists analysed radio signals from saturn picked up by voyager to calculate the length of day now dougherty and us scientists used an instrument called a magnetometer on the cassini spacecraft which measures the planets magnetic field by analysing data collected by cassini they found a clear period in the planets magnetic field that they suggest indicates a day lasts hours minutes and seconds give or take seconds the period we found from the magnetic field measurements has remained constant since cassini entered orbit almost two years ago while radio measurements since the voyager era have shown large variability says dr giacomo giampieri the lead author of the study from nasas jet propulsion laboratory by measuring the magnetic field over the rest of the mission we will be able to solve this puzzle australia can expect a drier east and north if a crucial pacific current continues to weaken scientists say the vast looping system of air currents that fuels pacific trade winds and climate from south america to southeast asia may be another victim of climate change scientists say this could mean more el nintildeolike weather patterns in the us more rain in the western pacific and less nourishment for marine life along the equator and off the south american coast and australias north and east would probably be drier than normal known as the walker circulation this system of currents functions as a huge belt stretching across the tropical pacific with dry air moving eastward at high altitude from asia to south america and moist air flowing westward along the oceans surface pushing the prevailing trade winds when the moist air gets to asia it triggers massive rains in indonesia then it dries out rises and starts the cycle again heading east this important system has weakened by over the past years and the culprit is probably humaninduced climate change scientists report in todays issue of the journal nature this is the impact of humans through burning coal burning benzene gasoline everything says author dr gabriel vecchi of the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration and an author of the study its principally the greenhouse gases from fossilfuel burning the observed slowdown has been more pronounced in the past years vecchi says noting this fits with what theorists and computer models predict should happen as a result of humaninduced global warming it is not consistent with any natural fluctuation in the system vecchi says even this relatively small weakening in the walker circulation means a much larger slowing of windforced ocean currents the scientists say this could spur el nintildeolike effects vecchi says and these in turn could have an impact as far as the us south america and australia while these potential effects are being studied vecchi says it could mean more rain in the southern us droughts elsewhere in north america and more rain in pacific islands like kiribati the slowdown in ocean currents is also expected to cut down on bottomtotop ocean circulation that brings nutrients up to the surface where marine life can feed on them the scientists say this could affect fishing in the equatorial pacific the weakening of the walker circulation is projected to continue and could weaken another by the scientists report this could mean ocean flow could decrease by close to according to australias bureau of meteorology as the walker circulation weakens say during an el nintildeo event seas around australia cool and slackened trade winds feed less moisture into the australiaasia region this means that eastern and northern australia will probably be drier than normal china reportedly has up to million blog sites chinas internet minders have vowed to step up controls of internet content especially in the most active areas of blogs bulletin boards and search engines state media said this week as more and more illegal and unhealthy information spread through blogs and search engines we will take effective measures to put the bbs bulletin board service blogs and search engines under control xinhua news agency quoted cai wu a government spokesman as saying china was taking steps to make registration mandatory on millions of blog sites and bbss or sites where internet users can converse online cai said according to a report by tsinghua university quoted by xinhua china currently has up to million blog sites a figure that could grow to million by the end of the year the number of search engine users had reached million or about of all internet users the report said we will speed up the technology development to safeguard the network management and do more research on the internet security issues triggered by the new technologies in blogs and search engines the report quoted wang xudong minister of information industry as saying china has for years been waging an online battle to censor the internet of pornographic and violent content while also stifling political and religious material that it believes could spark social unrest two years ago all chinese web portals were required to register with the government while they also signed on to government issued regulations to selfpolice their sites for unhealthy content rules at the time also required all chinese internet cafes to register web surfers and not allow them to download or upload any content onto or from personal devices human and media rights groups say chinas leaders are tightening their control over the internet and traditional press amid increasing social unrest and regularly jail journalists and internet commentators who post antigovernment material on the web a new domestic windmill could help bring wind power closer to home and be safer for birds people could soon generate their own wind energy with a new type of domestic windmill that plugs straight into the grid the windmill which is still at the prototype stage differs from others already available as it needs fewer components to operate and is said to be cheaper its australian developer the solarshop in adelaide says its also safer for birds compared to larger windmills the company this week received a commercialising emerging technologies grant from the australian government to develop the product further current domesticscale wind turbines produce around to volts and rely on costly inverters to convert this to volts says adrian ferraretto managing director of the solarshop the new generator will eliminate the need for an inverter the company says and will be cheaper than alternatives on the market feeding electricity back into the grid enables a householder to turn their electricity meter backwards and get credit on their electricity bill ferraretto says that over a year with an annual average wind speed of metres per second the generator would produce around a worth of electricity wind farms typically require an annual average wind speed of metres per second he says not quite rooftop the windmill needs a windy area free of nearby trees and buildings to work its really sitespecific says ferraretto you dont want to put it in the wrong spot or youll be throwing your money away we think the main market will be coastal acreages around australia and the world he says people will probably prefer to mount the generator on a freestanding tower away from the house people with beautiful homes wouldnt want one of these on their roof says ferraretto king tutenkhamens penis was there all along scientists say it wasnt stolen and sold as rumours suggested king tutankhamens rediscovered penis could make the pharaoh stand out in the shrunken world of male mummies scientists say theyve taken a close look at old pictures of the yearold mummified king his sexual organ has been just another puzzle in the story of the bestknown pharaoh of ancient egypt harry burton photographed the royal penis intact during howard carters excavation of king tuts tomb in but it was reported missing in when uk scientist professor ronald harrison took a series of xrays of the mummy there was speculation that the penis had been stolen and sold instead it has always been there i found it during the ct scan last year when the mummy was lifted it lay loose in the sand around the kings body it was mummified says professor zahi hawass chief of egypts supreme council of antiquities at first look burtons pictures may seem to indicate that king tut could have been a little better endowed but according to mummy expert dr eduard egarter vigl the pharaoh was built normally egarter is caretaker of oumltzi the iceman the worlds oldest and bestpreserved mummy and was also a member of the egyptianled research team that examined king tuts ct scan images the pharaohs sex organ is clearly visible in burtons pictures all was normal in king tut the penis is a highly vascularised organ and shrinks when it is mummified actually king tut has been flattered by the embalmers work there is no comparison with oumltzis penis says egarter mummifying the penis oumltzis natural mummification and dehydration in an alpine glacier produced a collapse of the genitalia which left the iceman with an almost invisible member he would not make a bella figura today egarter says according to the mummy expert it is not possible to see if king tut was circumcised eugene cruzuribe professor of history at northern arizona university and an expert on tutankhamen says that some earlier documents mention circumcision at king tuts time it was probably done for hygienic reasons but some ritual issues may have occurred as well cruzuribe says boy as king tutankhamun the living image of amun ascended the throne in bc at the age of nine and reigned until his death in bc aged he married yearold ankhesenpaaten who was probably his stepsister on his accession to the throne during their marriage ankhesenpaaten who had changed her name to ankhesenamun gave birth to two stillborn girls this gelatinous zooplankton athorybia was among the many species scientists found deep in the ocean scientists have found to new species of tiny creatures in the depths of the atlantic says an international report the survey of tropical waters between the eastern us and the midatlantic ridge used special nets to catch thousands of species of fragile zooplankton new finds included six types of ostracods a shrimplike creature and other species of zooplankton such as swimming snails and worms zooplankton are mostly millimeters long but range up to jellyfish trailing long tails they live at lightless depths of to kilometres and are swept by ocean currents this was a voyage of exploration the deepest parts of the oceans are hardly ever sampled says dr peter wiebe the cruises scientific leader and senior scientist at the woods hole oceanographic institution in the us we found perhaps new species of zooplankton he says of the voyage by scientists from nations including australia in april the scientists also found new fish among types of fish caught the scientists found what may be a new type of black dragonfish with fanglike teeth growing up to about centimetres and a centimetrelong great swallower with wide jaws and a lightproducing organ to attract prey most life including commercial fish stocks is in the top kilometre of water but the scientists say the survey shows a surprising abundance even in the depths the survey will provide a benchmark to judge future changes to the oceans the scientists say by the research will provide a baseline against which future generations can measure changes to the zooplankton and their provinces caused by pollution overfishing climate change and other shifting environmental conditions says professor ann bucklin lead scientist for the zooplankton census project at the university of connecticut the expedition was funded by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration the findings are also part of a wider census of marine life trying to map the oceans sitting in silence might be better for your heart turning off relaxing music and sitting in silence is better for your health say italian and uk researchers they found while slow meditative music induces a relaxing effect its the gap between the music that has greater benefits for your circulation system dr luciano bernardi of the university of pavia and colleagues report their study in a recent issue of the journal heart the research was part of a wider look at how heart rate blood pressure and breathing rate fluctuate in response to music bernardi and his team asked men half practising musicians to listen to a random series of six minute musical tracks the tracks included raga a type of indian music slow and fast classical music techno rap and dodecaphonic or tone music that lacks a traditional rhythmic harmonic and melodic structure the researchers then measured their heart rate breathing blood pressure and other indicators of arousal or relaxation they repeated the experiment inserting minute periods of silence the researchers found that most of the music increased blood pressure and heart rate with a stronger effect seen with faster music this effect did not appear to depend on the style of music so fast classical music and techno had the same effect relaxing with music slow music produced a more relaxed affect especially during the pauses but during the silent interval study participants heart and breathing rates and blood pressures fell further therefore music may give pleasure and perhaps a health benefit as a result of this controlled alternation between arousal and relaxation bernardi says in musicians the silent interval also reduced activity of the sympathetic nervous system which triggers the fight or flight response the musicians also had more pronounced shifts in heart rate and breathing when they heard the music which the researcher says is probably associated with their ability to synchronise their breathing with the music phrase listening to music may have effects similar to that of relaxation techniques bernardi and his colleagues note focus then release this generally requires a person to focus his or her attention on something and then release it appropriate selection of music by alternating fast and slower rhythms and pauses can be used to induce relaxation and reduce sympathetic activity and thus may be potentially useful in the management of cardiovascular disease the researchers conclude a uk government says ufos may be just glowing clouds of plasma british defence authorities have come up with an explanation for ufos that is bound to disappoint those who are convinced theyve seen a flying saucer a ministry of defence report which will be made public later this month says what ufo watchers may be seeing unusual atmospheric effects like glowing plasma clouds considerable evidence exists to support the thesis that the events are almost certainly attributable to physical electrical and magnetic phenomena in the atmosphere the report concludes plasma is an ionised gas described by sir william crookes in as radiant matter because of its tendency to glow a plasma effect is also responsible for spectacular auroras like the northern lights aurora borealis and southern lights aurora australis says astronomer dr paul francis of the australian national university francis says he sometimes investigates reported ufo sightings at the mount stromlo observatory where he is a fellow and plasma clouds provide a plausible explanation its quite clear that there are lights in the sky that people really do see and its quite clear theyre not aliens he says radiant matter plasma clouds are electrically conductive collections of charged particles they form when theres an equal distribution of positive and negative charges making the overall charge neutral a plasma cloud is going to be by nature composed of electrons and ions says professor iver cairns a space physicist from the university of sydney when they recombine to form atoms theyre going to release light and therefore they will glow he says plasma clouds tend to stick together but they can be shaped by magnetic forces and factors like winds in the normal atmosphere lightning can also cause plasma clouds francis says whenever you get a lot of energy such as a lightning bolt or an aurora caused by the winds of the sun this generates plasma he says gas has to be pretty hot to turn into plasma ball lightning professor bob vincent from the school of chemistry and physics at the university of adelaide says ufo observers may also be seeing ball lightning mysterious orbs of glowing light also attributed to plasma the cause of ball lightening is still not well known and theres some discussion of whether thats plasma clouds induced by lightning he says other explanations for ufos have included upsidedown mirages caused by light over the horizon meteors and weather balloons particularly at sunset francis says venus is commonly mistaken for a ufo and a british battleship even fired at it during world war ii does plasma affect your brain plasmas can also cause extended memory retention and repeat experiences of ufo sightings because they generate strong electromagnetic fields which affect the temporal lobes of the brain one newspaper report quotes the uk defence scientists as saying but francis says this is unlikely electromagnetic fields do have an effect on people but this is a very small effect he says if there was a plasma ball sitting three inches in front of your nose it might have some effect but these clouds are many kilometres away dr david clarke and gary anthony of sheffield hallam university will present findings from the report unidentified aerial phenomena in the uk air defence region later this week the report which they obtained under a freedom of information request will also appear on the uk ministry of defences website next week flaws in a digital image caused by dust on the optics or natural variation between pixels can be used to say whether a particular camera took a particular image a new technique matches a digital image to the camera that snapped it scientists say just like matching a bullet to the gun that fired it the method could help bolster investigations that need reliable evidence to tie a suspects illegal digital photos to their camera such as in child pornography cases when a suspect is caught with images on the computer and the suspect has a digital camera in possession the standard defence is that the images are computergenerated or downloaded from the internet says dr jessica fridrich an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the state university of new york in binghamton imagine now that you can tie them unmistakably to the camera that is in possession of the suspect fridich and her colleagues report their method in the june issue of ieee transactions on information security and forensics in the past forensic scientists could link print photographs to analog cameras for example they could match unique scratches on the negative film to the mechanical part of the camera that advances the film but until now scientists have been unable to find a cheap reliable and robust method for locating subtle flaws in digital images and video created unintentionally by a specific camera it turns out that those flaws created by such things as dust specks on the optics interference in optical elements and natural variations between pixels are captured on the cameras image sensor as a unique pattern of noise capturing noise to isolate the pattern noise created by an individual camera fridrich and her team took images with each of nine different cameras they uploaded the images to a computer and using software they developed analysed the images pixel by pixel by assigning values to the variations found between pixels the pattern noise they came up with a numerical fingerprint unique to each camera once they had the numerical fingerprint they used the mathematical process of correlation to compare the numerical fingerprints to the pattern noise from thousands of other images taken with the cameras the higher the correlation number the more likely an image came from a particular camera in the forensics lab when using this method in a reallife situation forensic scientists would take a bunch of digital images with the camera in question to come up with a numerical fingerprint next they would isolate the digital fingerprint extracted from the illegal images and correlate that number with the one from the camera the higher the number the more likely a conviction in laboratory experiments fridrich and her team matched several thousand different images to the correct camera without a single misclassification even when images were compressed or resized dr hany farid associate professor of computer science at dartmouth college in the us is an expert in digital image forensics this is one of the first papers out there to have what i think is a realisable robust and effect technique for doing it he says but farid questions whether the method will work to distinguish a few images from the millions of potential cameras on the market for now fridrichs technique works with digital still images but she is hoping to soon move to scanners and digital video australian backswimmmers have their very own underwater oxygen supply tiny aquatic bugs hitch a ride on airfilled buoyancy bubbles for minutes at a time while they fossick for food australian scientists show this means the insects which are about the size of a grain of rice can stay still and out of harms way details of how the australian backswimmer anisops deanei controls its depth are published today in the journal nature backswimmers are diving insects that use their broad oarlike legs to swim on their backs while many airbreathing aquatic insects dive with air bubbles it appears the backswimmers use haemoglobin to help keep them stationary below the surface while waiting for prey the trick allows them to dive for food in the safer midwater zone rather than scavenge at the surface or cling to submerged objects like most other airbreathing aquatic insects say the researchers this is the ideal hunting zone for tiny aquatic bugs because at a metre below sea level its out of the reach of larger predators that hang around the waters surface and those that wait in deeper waters looking at bubbles researchers from the university of adelaide used a sensitive electronic balance and fibreoptic oxygen sensors to measure the gas pressure inside the bubble the backswimmer carries they found that the insect uses a strategy much like a diver with a buoyancy vest to control the depth at which he or she hovers in the water backswimmers breath in a bubble of oxygen they take with them on their dive and they maintain buoyancy by releasing oxygen from the haemoglobin in their bodies explains phd candidate philip matthews from the department of environmental biology the haemoglobin acts as an oxygen tank so the backswimmer can carry oxygen down from the surface in this tank and then breath into their bubble as they need it before resurfacing again he says backswimmers found the world over are the only insects to inhabit the midwater zone as adults and the only ones to possess haemoglobin throughout their entire life a link that may be explained by the new findings learning a musical instrument can change the way we remember musicians use unique mental processes when it comes to recognising a tune but this trait is learnt rather than inherent a researcher says phd student david brennan from the university of western sydney has shown that people with musical training appear to have different memory pathways compared to others he will present his findings at a symposium on memory and the performing arts at the international conference on memory in sydney in july brennan tested the ability of people including musicians and nonmusicians to recognise musical themes from popular tv shows such as friends law and order and mash they were required to differentiate between the original theme and a transposed version where pitch tempo or both pitch and tempo had been changed differences between musicians and nonmusicians brennan found both musicians and nonmusicians could identify the original theme when it was compared with a version where just the pitch or tempo was changed but musicians did much better at identifying the original theme compared to a version where both pitch and tempo had been changed proportionally or had been moved up and down by exactly the same degree this suggests that nonmusicians remember music as an integrated piece of information but musicians compartmentalise elements of the music and store them as discreet blocks brennan says i found that nonmusicians store the sound as a more of a composite picture they take the entire piece of information and store it relationally between all the different aspects he says musicians store it as individual parameters for example tempo key and timbre he says storing relational information is more efficient than storing it as separate elements but the compartmentalised approach is more accurate this reflects the fact that remembering musical sequences has a lower priority for nonmusicians than for those who make music their craft are musicians born or made brennan says the research suggests that learning a musical instrument can change your mental pathways it suggests that over time musicians training leads them down particular paths of how to store information he says i dont think it indicates any prewiring of brains but it certainly suggests that over a period of many years of training they allocate their perceptual resources a little differently than other people the research also sheds more light on the mechanisms that govern how we remember things brennan says this probably represents the fact that as you allocate more time and training to dealing with the fine details of information you tend to store it in more separate categories conversely it suggests that for the many things we have to deal with that arent focal points we have a very elegantly efficient way of joining them into one single relationship construct you called bottlenose dolphins can call each other by name when they whistle making them the only animals to do this besides humans scientists report scientists have long known that dolphins whistling calls include repeated information thought to be their names but a new study published online today in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences indicates dolphins recognise these names even when voice cues are removed from the sound for example a dolphin might be expected to recognise its name if called by its mother but the new study found most dolphins recognise names their signature whistles even when emitted without inflection or other vocal cues more than that two dolphins may refer to a third by the third animals name says study author dr laela sayigh from the university of north carolina wilmington they are known to produce these individually distinctive signature whistles like names sayigh says the scientists already knew that dolphins responded to whistles but wondered if something in the actual voice of the whistling dolphin is making the identity clear or if the name itself is enough for recognition to find out they studied bottlenose dolphins in sarasota bay florida instead of playing recordings of actual dolphins making signature whistles the researchers synthesised signature whistles with the callers voice features removed and played them to dolphins through an underwater speaker in nine out of cases the dolphin would turn more often toward the speaker if it heard a whistle that sounded like a close relatives its a very interesting finding that encourages further research because they are using whistles as referential signals thats what words are says sayigh dolphins appear to be using these arbitrary signals to identify another dolphin she stopped short of saying dolphins might have a humanlike language i tend to shy away from using the word language myself because its such a loaded term sayigh says i still really feel strongly that there is no evidence for something like our language dolphins have got the cognitive skills at least to have referential signals bored with khaki scientits say new fibres could oneday be used to make camouflage clothing change colour a new conductive plastic that changes colour in response to an electric field could be used in products from hueswitching camouflage gear to flexible computer displays researchers say the electrochromic polymers developed by dr greg sotzing an associate professor at the university of connecticut are said to be longer and more flexible than other conductive polymers which are short and brittle you want them to be long in length to twist them together to make thread or yarn says sotzing but its the rigidity of the chemical structure that helps conductive polymers carry a charge in the first place until now that stiff structure has limited how such polymers can be processed into fibres and other useful materials sotzing and his team devised a twostep method to convert flexible nonconductive precursor polymers into long conductive fibres lots of goo the first step is to melt or dissolve the precursor polymer into a gooey solution the researchers then apply a voltage to a special syringe and squeeze the solution through it this process doesnt charge the polymer but helps to evaporate solvents as a result the polymers harden and become tangled together like the strands of a rope polymers extruded by the new method can be lengthened up to about a metre and potentially much longer the researchers say at first the fibres appear white if the researchers dip them into a chemical solution that removes electrons the fibres become conductive and darken to a deep blue if the researchers apply an electric charge to add electrons the colour changes to bright orange dr shawn williams is vicepresident of technology at pittsburghbased plextronics a company that develops conductive polymer technology for electronic devices for a long time people have known about electrochromic polymers but they havent figured out how to put them into formats that are useable and practical he says what sotzing has done says williams is create a conductive polymer with the versatile properties of a regular polymer fabric that changes colour the trick for making the fibres useful for colourchanging fabrics according to williams is to control the fibres on the scale of a single pixel threads with different charges could be woven together with thin metal wires designed to deliver various voltages with the intersection between a thread and a wire serving as a pixel changing the voltage with an embedded battery would result in different colours a fabric woven with the polymer fibres could be used for example in tshirts bearing video advertisements or jackets that double as computers the material could also be used by soldiers to blend into both forested and urban environments sotzing says he is speaking to both a us and international company about commercialisation some of us are extreme dreaders whose brains register more than simple fear anyone who has ever waited in dread for the dentist may find some comfort in the findings of a new brain study for some people researchers say the waiting is indeed the hardest part and finding a distraction might help their study published in the journal science used the brainimaging technique of functional mri to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying dread the researchers looked specifically at the agony of waiting to have a painful procedure among volunteers who agreed to have a series of electric shocks to the foot some of them dreaded each shock so much that they repeatedly opted to have a highervoltage jolt just so they could get it over with more quickly these individuals dubbed extreme dreaders showed greater activity in a brain region related to both pain and attention the findings say the researchers indicate that dread arises not from simple fear but from the brains attention to the unpleasant event the dread is often worse than the event itself says lead study author dr gregory berns a professor of psychiatry and behavioural sciences at emory university school of medicine in atlanta he says the brainimaging results are good news because they indicate that extreme dreaders can do something to alleviate the problem they can find a distraction such as meditation exercise or some other activity to take the focus off the anticipated event shocking results for the study berns and his colleagues took brain images of volunteers who agreed to endure electrical shocks to their feet first each jolt was preceded by a cue that told participants how intense it would be for instance of their maximum pain tolerance and how long they would have to wait for it in a second go participants were presented with choices on how each shock should be delivered with the voltage and timing of the jolt as the variables for example they could choose between having a shock at of their maximum pain tolerance delivered in the next seconds or one at intensity in seconds extreme dreaders of the volunteers nine the extreme dreaders consistently opted for the stronger shock to avoid the longer wait this may seem illogical to many people berns says but for extreme dreaders avoiding the anguished wait makes sense and it was the extreme dreaders who showed particularly high activity in the brains socalled pain matrix during the buildup to their electrical shocks activity was specifically high in areas related to attention but not in those associated with fear and anxiety in other words extreme dreaders were giving more attention to their foot than mild dreaders were wheatgrass contains high levels of phytonutrients which are believed to have antioxidant qualities wheatgrass juice may not be quite the tonic that many people think according to a review that finds little evidence for many of its health claims the review published in the australian consumers association choice magazine concludes that while wheatgrass has some nutritional value its no miracle drink the review found only limited supporting evidence for claims of the antiinflammatory and woundhealing properties of wheatgrass and little confirmation for claims it builds red blood cells and improves circulation and tissue oxygenation wheatgrass juice is made of the pulped shoots of grasses from the genus agropyron is a relative of wheat and has become a staple of juice bars marketers and enthusiasts say the benefits of this dark green juice range from purifying blood to preventing cancer and making your faeces less smelly its certainly not bad for you but the claims that are made are perhaps a lot of hype without any real evidence says viola korczak health policy officer at the australian consumers association she says larger controlled clinical trials are needed what the research says choice reviewed the available scientific research on wheatgrass juice including botanical studies animal studies and a dozen small human trials it found there are more vitamins and minerals including calcium vitamin c and folic acid in grams of cooked spinach broccoli or a garden salad than in a shot of wheatgrass juice some reports link wheatgrass to improvements in eczema fractures burns osteoarthritis and skin cancer but it is unclear whether wheatgrass is directly responsible the review says other studies report that the green pigment chlorophyll which makes up of wheatgrass juice shares molecular similarities with haemoglobin but this doesnt mean it enhances red blood cell production as far as evidence goes theres little to be found the report concludes a study of patients with the blood disorder beta thalassaemia found wheatgrass juice reduced transfusions in half but not the other half meanwhile experiments in labs and on animals showed wheatgrass may work against genetic mutations choice says largely because of the antioxidant activity of some of its compounds such as flavonoids but theres no evidence for humans and theres nothing to substantiate claims that wheatgrass can help dissolve tumours the report says too early to write off wheatgrass juice professor marc cohen president of the australasian integrative medicine association and head of complementary medicine at rmit university says its too early to write off wheatgrass juice he says its a minimally processed wholefood with high levels of phytochemicals which play a role in growth signalling in plants and are associated with reduced blood pressure reduced cholesterol and cancer prevention in humans you want to be eating wholefoods so you get as many phytonutrients as possible he says dr peter clifton head of csiros nutrition clinic says wheatgrass is very trendy but it probably isnt any different from any other type of grass he says it may have more polyphenolics a type of phytochemical because it is an actively growing plant this may account for one studying showing millilitres of wheatgrass a day over a month reduced symptoms of ulcerative colitis he says he says claims about the health benefits of wheatgrass have been around for decades but the evidence is still lacking i guess the wheatgrass juice industry should put its money where its mouth is and test the level of polyphenolics he says women can just look at a man and tell if he likes children a new study shows dont bother with months of email courtship pay only polite attention to the advice of your friends and as for those jane austenstyle books on how to select mr right leave them to gather dust on the shop shelves a more reliable way for a woman to judge whether a man will be a suitable mate is to look at him in the face and to trust her instincts us scientists say in a study published in proceedings of the royal society b a journal of the uks royal society psychologists test a key hypothesis about male attractiveness in a nutshell this theory says that women are frankly ambivalent they might fancy men who are hunky and macho but they also like the kind caring types these preferences may seem contradictory but there is a solid genetic cause for it a strong beefy squarejawed man represents the best potential for producing a healthy baby whereas a caring friendly sensitive man represents the best potential for protecting and nurturing the offspring indeed studies into female hormones and sex drive say a woman will find a masculine face more attractive when she ovulates but switch to a more feminine preference during the other phases of her menstrual cycle a team led by assistant professor james roney of the university of california at santa barbara has now put the theory to the test in an experiment combining psychology and hormones looking at faces they recruited male students aged to who were photographed with their faces framed in an oval to obscure information about hairstyles and with a neutral facial expression the men also gave saliva samples which were assessed for levels of the key male hormone testosterone and were asked to look at pictures of babies and to rate how much they liked children the photos were then individually assessed by undergraduate women students aged to they were asked to rate each man one a onetoseven scale for likes children masculine physically attractive and kind they were then asked to rate the mens attractiveness as a shortterm romantic partner eg for a brief affair and as longterm romantic partner eg for a committed relationship such as marriage the man with the child in this eyes the researchers found the women were uncannily accurate in guessing which men liked children and which men were less interested or indifferent to kids the men who the women considered to be more masculine and a choice for a brief fling also had higher testosterone levels than their counterparts but the men whom the women preferred for a longterm relationship had a strong affinity for children roney says these findings provide the first direct evidence that women track mens hormone concentrations and liking for children when they formulate a judgement about attractiveness indeed mens interest in children may be a relatively underappreciated influence on mens longterm mate attractiveness he says more stereotypes men may despair about this pigeonholing just as women have long despaired about men who stereotype females by placing them into such categories as mother or sex bomb but they may also find a crumb of comfort the team saw no correlation between testosterone and liking for children in other words mr macho may like children and mr sensitive may not but the risk is that a woman may write them off respectively as a longterm or a shortterm mating prospect there may exist somewhat independent indices of mens genetic and paternal quality rather than a single dimension in which the two aspects of mate quality trade off against one another says the study flying robots like this fictional robotic dragonfly could bypass radar to deliver explosives or bioweapons experts say it may sound like science fiction but flying robots could make suicide bombers and hijackers redundant experts say the technology for remotecontrolled light aircraft is now highly advanced widely available and experts say virtually unstoppable models with a wingspan of metres capable of carrying up to kilograms remain undetectable by radar and thanks to satellite positioning systems they can now be programmed to hit targets some distance away within a few metres of their target security services the world over have been considering the problem for several years but no one has yet come up with a solution we are observing an increasing threat from such things as remotecontrolled aircraft used as small flying bombs against soft targets the head of the canadian secret services michel gauthier said at a conference in calgary recently according to gauthier ultralight aircraft powered hang gliders or powered paragliders have also been purchased by terrorist groups to circumvent groundbased countermeasures defence on alert on may the us website defensetech published an article by military technology specialist david hambling entitled terrorists unmanned air force while billions have been spent on ballistic missile defense little attention has been given to the more imminent threat posed by unmanned air vehicles in the hands of terrorists or rogue states writes hambling armed militant groups have already tried to use unmanned aircraft according to a number of studies by institutions including the center for nonproliferation studies in monterey california and the center for arms control energy and environmental studies in moscow in august for example the colombian military reported finding nine small remotecontrolled planes at a base it had taken from the revolutionary armed forces of colombia on april the lebanese shiite militia group hezbollah flew a pilotless drone over israeli territory on what it called a surveillance mission the israeli military confirmed this and responded by flying warplanes over southern lebanon easy to buy or make remotecontrol planes are not hard to get hold of according to jeanchristian delessert who runs a specialist model aeroplane shop near geneva putting together a largescale model is not difficult all you need is a few materials and a decent electronics technician he says in his view if terrorists get hold of that it will be impossible to do anything about it we did some tests with a friend who works at a military radar base they never detected us if the radar picks anything up it thinks it is a flock of birds and automatically wipes it japanese company yamaha meanwhile has produced a kilogram robot helicopter that is metres long and has a cc engine it flies close to the ground at about kilometres per hour and is already on the market bruce simpson an engineer from new zealand managed to produce an even more dangerous contraption in his own garage a minicruise missile he made it out of readily available materials at a cost of less than us about a according to simpsons website the new zealand authorities forced him to shut down the project though only once he had already finished making the missile under pressure from the us take them seriously dr eugene miasnikov of the center for arms control energy and environmental studies in moscow says these kinds of threats must be taken more seriously to many people uavs unmanned aerial vehicles may seem too exotic demanding substantial efforts and cost compared with the methods terrorists frequently use he says but science and technology is developing so fast that we often fail to recognise how much the world has changed a good budget for medical research in the short term says one expert the australian government should have spent more of its budget surplus on building the nations future rd capacity rather than tax breaks say commentators in the science community the federal budget has delivered a billion for science and innovation and million to universities primarily for capital developments while the government describes the spending on science and innovation as being at record level and points to a big boost given to medical research many say the governments spending priorities are leaving australia behind in terms of future capacity professor snow barlow of the university of melbourne says the amount spent on science and innovation may be a record in absolute terms but as a percentage of gross national product it is decreasing its actually lower than its been in years says barlow who is a former member of the prime ministers science engineering and innovation council he says australia is still investing less than competitors including china india and oecd countries and while he welcomes increased spending on health and aged care he says investment in that area will not spawn new industries i just dont see any investment in things that might drive the future prosperity of australia says barlow he says there should have been more funding for the australian research council especially the councils linkage grants which have contributions from industry innovative capability not addressed bradley smith executive director of federation of australian scientific and technological societies agrees medical research is the big winner from the budget the budget has quite a number of welcome oneoff initiatives which support infrastructure at a handful of universities and medical research institutes he says and he says there is a modest increase in research infrastructure for universities but he says there is a lack of commitment to education and skills development the overwhelming sense is there is still not a concerted effort by government to underpin the serious development of our innovative capability says smith medical research gets a minus the budget committed an additional a million over four years to the national health and medical research council provided a million for new health and medical research fellowships a million for stem cell research and over a million in additional funding for medical research institutes its a start in the right direction says professor kurt lambeck the new president of the australian academy of science as far as the medical research part is concerned id probably give it an a minus he says but other than medical theres really nothing in it that i can find in particular what i find disappointing is that there is no longterm investment in people lambeck says the new health and medical research fellowships may help stop the brain drain at the elite level there is still a major problem for most research scientists once they finish their phd and postdoctoral training expenditure on infrastructure is one thing says lambeck but is it going to provide the intellect to drive that infrastructure he says there should have been increased funding specifically for midcareer researchers to provide the transition from the postdoctoral fellowships to longterm commitments short term and even medical researchers have reservations about the budget overall this is a good budget for medical research in the short term says professor bob williamson of the university of melbourne and chair of the national committee for medicine of the australian academy of science the main concern that researchers will have is that compared to canada or european countries we still do not use much of our wealth to create a strategic infrastructure in science technology and education he says the right allocation of resources for the long term should be a high priority not only for the present generation but to ensure health and wealth for australia in the future other allocations in the budget include bull a million to restore the health of the murraydarling basin bull a million over four years to deal with illegal foreign fishing bull a million over three years to strengthen defences against bird flu bull a million over four years to boost pest and disease preparedness bull a million over the next four years to upgrade questacon national science and technology centre bull a million to help develop a research quality framework for research funding and bull a million per year funding increase for australian scientists collaborating on research projects with china new research suggests the habitat changed from dry arid and cold to warm and wet which led to new types of vegetion mammoths couldnt eat the mammoth and other species probably became extinct more than years ago because of climate shifts not overhunting by humans new research suggests radiocarbon dating of bones of bison moose and humans that survived the mass extinction and remains of the mammoth and wild horse that did not suggests humans were not responsible that is what this new data points out says emeritus professor dale guthrie of the university of alaska in fairbanks author of the paper in todays issue of the journal nature it is not that people werent hunting these creatures but climate would have reduced the numbers considerably he adds scientists have put forward various theories to explain the disappearance of the mammoth and the wild horse equus ferus which coincided with the arrival of humans from central asia in north america more than years ago one hypothesis suggests a virulent disease was responsible for the extinctions another theory was that by killing grazing animals humans triggered changes in vegetation that resulted in the mass deaths the blitzkrieg or overkill theory says human hunters devastated most large mammal species and drove some to extinction but contrary to that theory my dates show numbers of bison and elk were expanding both before and during human colonisation guthrie explains his radiocarbon research shows there was a year difference between the demise of the wild horse and the woolly mammoth which guthrie says is inconsistent with other theories instead he suggests climate shifts transformed the dry arid and cold region the wetter warmer summers led to changes in vegetation to which mammoths and wild horses could not adapt the new patterns of dates indicate a radical ecological sorting during a uniquely foragerich transitional period affecting all large mammals including humans guthrie adds triton pictured here in the foreground might have once belonged to a pair of passing planets neptune might have nabbed its giant moon triton from a pair of passing sister planets back when the solar system was young and when planets and their growing brood of satellites were angling for clear orbital slots around the sun a new study says dual systems like pluto and its large moon charon are not uncommon among objects in the kuiper belt region located beyond neptunes orbit astronomers say about of the known objects in this region have partners dr craig agnor with the university of california at santa cruz was sitting in a lecture about binary kuiper belt objects when he had the idea that neptune may have kidnapped its main moon triton from such a pair triton stands out among all the large moons in the solar system because it orbits neptune in a direction opposite to the planets rotation a socalled retrograde orbit most scientists explain the moons odd orbit and inclination by some variation of a capture scenario a collision between objects for example but agnor had long been troubled by details that did not fit with any of the interpretations its been this old problem to work on agnor says the existing answers there was something just a little unsettling about them thinking in twos agnor and university of maryland astronomer dr douglas hamilton report in todays issue of the journal nature that they used a binary system rather than a solitary object to generate a computer model of how the relationship started and they say this solved many of the theories flaws the most troubling conundrum was accounting for the tremendous amount of speed triton must have shed to leave itself vulnerable to neptunes gravitational embrace the collision theory for example would have required an impact so powerful that triton itself should have been destroyed scientists also have suggested that neptune once had an extended gaseous atmosphere which could have gradually slowed triton until it fell into orbit around neptune but neptune seemed to have evolved slowly and probably never had much more atmosphere than it has today says french astronomer dr alessandro morbidelli from the cocircte dazur observatory in a related nature article ripping off a moon agnor and hamilton show that if neptune chanced upon a pair of miniplanets similar to the plutocharon system the encounter could have ripped one from its partner computer models show that the object closer to neptune which in this case would have been triton would have lost enough velocity in the process to fall into orbit around its abductor the partner object would have probably been buffeted by neptunes gravity passed along to uranus and then saturn until it finally reached giant jupiter and was booted out of the solar system altogether agnor says the researchers are now curious to see if other eccentric moons in the solar system have similar life stories humans cause the vast majority of the to fires that occur across australia each year most people who deliberately light bushfires want some sort of change in their life and dont mean to cause harm say australian researchers dr colleen bryant of the australian institute of criminology will present research on deliberately lit fires at the australasian bushfire conference in brisbane next month there are many reasons why people light fires says bryant people are complex and of course the motives are complex while the community often views arsonists as pyromaniacs bryant and colleague matthew willis say very few deliberately lit fires are due to pyromania willis says in the majority of cases people who deliberately light bushfires do not intend to cause harm they dont tend to turn their mind to consequences of lighting a fire rather are focused on creating some change in their life while some want to relieve boredom by creating havoc and excitement other arsonists crave recognition or attention the researchers say some light fires out of anger or protest while others believe they are being altruistic by clearing what they see as dangerous fuelloads sometimes there are multiple motives targeting fire prevention campaigns understanding the motives of people who deliberately light fires can be useful in designing fire prevention campaigns and treatment programs for arsonists the researchers say for example willis says people who light fires for excitement will often stay around after the fire to view their handiwork he says this suggests fire crews should look around and talk to the people who are there watching knowing that some people light fires just so they can treated as a hero if they report the fire or put it out is also useful especially for fire services screening new members says willis unfortunately some of those people who light those fires do become members of fire services he says so the fire services can use that knowledge as part of their recruitment exercises bryant says knowing that a certain proportion of people get a thrill out of lighting fires on extreme bushfire days also helps fire services to look out for such people on those days different types of bushfires as well as deliberately lit fires there are a small number of humancaused fires that are lit without motive these include fires due to accidents people with mental disabilities who lack control over their actions and fires lit by children naturallycaused bushfires such as those that ravaged canberra in january are usually larger and more devastating than those lit by humans but the researchers say these account for less than of all bushfires they say the vast majority of the to fires that occur across australia each year are caused by humans with somewhere around of these being deliberately lit willis formerly of the australian institute of criminology analysed decades of studies including psychiatric assessments of arsonists who had lit building fires in towns and cities he then adapted the findings to the bush and came up with a motivebased classification system for people who deliberately light bushfires rungwecebus kipunji in the wild a new species of monkey identified in tanzanias highlands last year is an even more remarkable find than scientists once thought it belongs to a new genus of animal the first new living primate genus to be found in africa for years scientists report in the journal science the new monkey at first called the highland mangabey but now known as kipunji is more closely related to baboons than to mangabey monkeys but in fact deserves its own genus and species classification the researchers report so they have renamed it rungwecebus kipunji this is exciting news because it shows that the age of discovery is by no means over says william stanley mammal collection manager at the field museum in chicago which has a dead specimen of the greyishbrown monkey finding a new genus of the beststudied group of living mammals is a sobering reminder of how much we have to learn about our planets biodiversity adds assistant professor link olson of the university of alaska museum who worked with stanley and others on the report the new african monkey whose discovery was reported in science almost precisely a year ago was originally placed in the genus lophocebus commonly known as mangabeys rare and shy it was identified only by photographs but then a farmer trapped one and it died and scientists could get a close look including doing some dna testing olsons genetic analysis showed the monkey is most closely related to baboons in the genus papio and not to mangabeys had we gotten these surprising results based on a single gene wed have been pretty skeptical but each of the genes we analysed either firmly supported the grouping of kipunji with baboons or failed to support a close relationship between kipunji and other mangabeys olson says almost a metre tall an adult kipunji is about centimetres tall with a long tail long greyishbrown fur a black face hands and feet adults make a distinctive loud lowpitched honkbark call they live in mountainside trees at elevations of up to metres and eat leaves shoots flowers bark fruit lichen moss and invertebrates the last new genus of african monkey to be named was allens swamp monkey discovered in but not recognised as a new genus until to find in the st century an entirely new species of large monkey living in the wild is surprising enough to find one that can be placed in a new genus and that sheds new light on the evolutionary history of the monkeys of africa and eurasia as a whole is truly remarkable says professor john oates a professor of anthropology at hunter college in new york this discovery also reinforces the view that mountains in southern tanzania have played an important and until recently unexpected role as a refuge for many species long extinct elsewhere more than cases of clostridium difficile seen here and its cousin c sordellii occur in the us each year including a handful in women who have taken the ru abortion pill the cause of increasing rare but deadly bacterial infections including a handful of cases in women who have taken the controversial ru abortion pill is still unclear and needs further study us health experts say two sometimes fatal bugs clostridium sordellii and c difficile are a particular worry as antibiotic resistance grows and infections occur in people usually not at risk doctors and researchers say while infections have been reported in drug users surgical patients and accident victims including men cases in women who took ru drew the most scrutiny at the centers for disease control cdc this week officials from the cdc food and drug administration fda and national institutes of health sought input from outside experts on what research and tracking systems are needed dr paul seligman fda associate director for safety policy says it is not clear what is causing the spike what we do know is that in this country we are seeing the simultaneous emergence of two virulent often fatal illnesses affecting otherwise healthy people he says more difficult to treat more than c difficile cases occur each year in the us experts say the diarrhoeacausing disease is usually manageable but has recently become more difficult to treat c sordellii is far more rare and previously was not known to be toxic over the past few years the picture has changed seligman says drawing the most scrutiny are cases involving ru a drug that is taken with another called misoprostol early in pregnancy to trigger an abortion six women who took ru also known as mifeprex or mifepristone have died since four died from clostridium infection one was ruled unrelated and the other is still being investigated officials have not directly linked the deaths to the drug the cdc says it is investigating another fatal case involving a woman who took misoprostol as part of an abortion procedure another fatal infection following medical abortion has yet to be confirmed ten other deadly infections have been reported in women who had given birth or who had miscarriages more study needed several womens groups and others ru supporters say the infections need more study while abortion opponents say the data shows the pill is too risky to stay on the market two experts also questioned the pill dr james mcgregor a gynaecologist from the university of colorado health sciences center urged officials to reduce or eliminate mifeprex use overall panelists encouraged further study especially on women we clearly need controlled trials says dr dale gerding of hines veterans affairs hospital in illinois most also say limited government data make tracking infections tough and urge better reporting systems antiobiotics the answer it is not immediately clear what action the fda might take regarding ru or if officials would suggest use of antibiotics to prevent infection fdas deputy director of the office of new drugs sandra kweder says the meeting shows the picture is much more complicated than the cases involving the abortion pill this is a far more complex medical and epidemiological situation than originally might have appeared to be the case and well be trying to factor that into any actions that we take she says fragment b of comet p schwassmannwachmann and some of the minicomets that have broken off giant telescopes around the world are capturing more spectacular views of the nearearth disintegration of comet pschwassmanwachmann the comet is now comprised of scores of fragments and zillions of tinier pieces a new infrared image from the spitzer space telescope of the unfolding destruction captures what looks like a line of steam engines following a common cosmic track each engine is a comet fragment boiling away plumes of dust and gas as they are blasted by the solar wind the track the fragments are following is a line of sunwarmed comet debris dust and fine sand that the comet left in space on its previous year cycles around the sun we hadnt seen that with this comet says astronomer michael kelley a doctoral student at the university of minnesota twin cities and member of the team that made the spitzer telescope observations its been suspected because its associated with a meteor shower comet debris streams linked to specific comets like that seen in the spitzer image are the cause of many regular predictable meteor showers when earth ploughs through the debris at the same point of its orbit each year the debris burns up in our atmosphere creating a meteor shower following the debris trail the astronomers are hoping that by measuring the brightness of the extent of the debris trail which cant be see in visible light they can find out whether most of the comet vaporises from evaporating ice the housesized chunks seen in recent hubble space telescope images or by way of meteorsized debris seen in the spitzer images we suspect that every comet goes through an episode like this says kelley of those comets that dont die by plunging into the sun or into a planet its the details that have been elusive and why comet pschwassmanwachmann s breakup so conveniently near earth is getting so much attention yesterday for instance some brand new visible light images of the comet from may were released by astronomers who caught the disintegration drama with the metre subaru telescope in hawaii compared to observations five days before by vlt the very large telescope in chile we see some more parts coming off says dr catherine ishida of the national astronomical observatory of japan which operates the subaru telescope on mauna kea one subaru closeup of the wake of the comets fragment b shows distinct miniature comets dropping away in the wake subaru astronomers have counted such minicomets big telescopes will continue to take turns looking at the comet when there is time and until the comet is too close to the sun for the telescopes to look without damaging their instruments ishida says each new view tells another part of the story the key thing is that the comet is changing rapidly she says scientists are using star vibrations to tell them what stars are made of juggling multiple roles seems to be good for womens health new research shows juggling a career with family life may help to keep women healthy a new study shows women who have multiple roles are less likely than homemakers single mothers or childless women to report poor health or to be obese in middle age the uk researchers report their results in the latest issue of the journal of epidemiology and community health women who occupied multiple roles over the long term reported relatively good health at age says lead author dr anne mcmunn of university college london it looks like women are relatively healthy as a result of combining work and family life mcmunn and her team analysed selfreported health records of more than women born in the scientists then tracked the women in their mids and mids measuring their body mass index information on their marital status work history and whether they had children was also included the researchers found that women who had been homemakers most of their lives were most likely to report poor health followed by single mothers and childless women homemakers tended to gain weight more quickly and had the highest rate of obesity at while women who were employees wives and mothers had the lowest mcmunn says it has been known for some time that women who combine employment with motherhood and partnership have better health but it was not clear whether they were working and having children because they were healthy or whether they were healthy because they were combining the two this study is the first to show which way that direction runs she adds there may be potential longterm health benefits of being able to participate in all areas of society it may look like farmyard junk but new research says it paints a unique picture of our agricultural heritage so has great cultural value farm graveyards those piles of abandoned vehicles and rusty machinery that dot rural landscapes are like cherished living photo albums and family heirlooms thats the conclusion of di smith a phd candidate at flinders university of south australia after studying the archaeology of farm graveyards her study believed to be the first of its type in australia and possibly the world found these graveyards are part of our cultural heritage and of great archaeological value i was looking for the answer to my questions of why do farmers keep all these abandoned vehicles and machinery on their property why do they keep them for so long and what do they do with them smith says smith sent out questionnaires to farmers including woolgrowers crocodile farmers grain croppers pig and avocado farmers across australia of the nearly farmers who responded said they had farm graveyards many of them inherited of those that didnt have sites many said they used to have one and regretted getting rid of it to the scrap dealer to farmers these sites were very special and had a very useful purpose in recycling it became very clear to me that they were not just rubbish dumps where farmers disposed of stuff and never looked at it again smith says she followed up her questionnaire by conducting detailed artefact surveys and inventories mapping the sites and recording the histories of farm graveyard sites across south australia and victoria she then looked at sites in alberta canada sites in australia and canada share many similarities smith says but canadian farmers were very neat in their approach often lining their equipment up in neat rows along fences so that they are very accessible both countries farmers are inventive when it comes to recycling for instance using old machinery for spare parts smith says her research gives important insight into the deeper meaning these sites hold for farmers and their families they have an important meaning as an agricultural heritage it tells farmers who they are where theyve been and where they might be going to as far as a place that encapsulates their cultural heritage she says to them the graveyards are as valuable as a museum collection or a photo album because they can walk through it and visit all these old friends along the way smiths research which is being showcased during national archaeology week next week is being considered for publication research into digital signal processing chips didnt live up to one researchers promises the scandal of a chinese scientist who lied about his inventions is just the tip of the iceberg in an academic environment where analysts say incentives to cheat are great and the risk of being found out is small professor chen jin dean of the microelectronics school at the prestigious shanghai jiaotong university was fired after a government investigation found he had faked research on his hanxin series of digital signal processing chips authorities announce the research was seen as an important step in helping china wean itself off reliance on foreign technology but a twomonth investigation found chens chips could not perform the functions he claimed according to the xinhua news agency and he used another companys research and claimed it as his own the case was discovered only after a colleague blew the whistle and after chen had received large grants from the government and was praised as one of the countrys top young scientists analysts say the case shows there are many pitfalls as the government strives to encourage its top schools and industries to come up with their own technological inventions to help the country catch up with the west pressure on scientists and academics is also intense leading some to take shortcuts analysts say in the past academics were evaluated through a long process of monitoring their work nowadays there is pressure to show results quickly says dr fan peilei a chinese postdoctoral fellow at the un university in yokohama japan who specialises in chinas hightech industries the salary now is based on how many papers you issue what new inventions you come up with but there is no domestic or overseas system to scrutinise chinese researchers work fan says in western countries its very open with chinese research partly due to the language problem and lack of recognition that china can invent anything good there is no one properly checking the work she says if theres some claim that some scientist invented something theres no proper international review system the domestic supervision system is also not mature looking to the west an unnamed internet commentator says online that the root of the problem is china is too anxious to catch up with technologically advanced countries few people recognise reaching the level of the west is a longterm process he says there are fears the case could bring chinese inventions into disrepute this will have a negative impact on the whole chip industry says zhang ming of hangzhou guoxin a company that develops computer chips for satellites and cable tv the governments current fiveyear plan for the period places special emphasis on developing an innovationdriven economy to rely less on simply being the worlds factory for lowcost goods at the same time complaints about academic corruption have been more vocal and there are signs that the government is waking up to the problem in february the education ministry urged people to report academic fraud saying it was very concerned about the problem this year two other academics were publicly disciplined a professor at the medical school of chinas ivy leaguetype tsinghua university was demoted in march after being accused of lying about his accomplishments on his cv and a tianjin foreign language institute professor accused of plagiarism in winning a professorship was dismissed after losing a lawsuit in january granted there is a lot of good scientific research in china that is genuine the case should serve as a warning to everyone fan says fan however praises authorities for announcing the microchip case thats an improvement this is very different from years ago she says greg shea president of the us information technology office an industry lobby group in beijing agrees i think it is encouraging to see unfortunate incidents like this are coming to the attention of government officials shea says the role of the education system rd system and government funding all of this is being examined and looked at with fresh eyes in light of the high level of focus on creating an innovation society thats good for domestic industry and foreign industry the government has banned chen from conducting further state research and ordered him to give back investment money will new copyright laws protect online artists the federal governments proposed changes to australian copyright law fail to address issues facing digital artists experts say attorney general philip ruddock announced the reforms this week saying they would make the law fairer for consumers and tougher on copyright pirates but damien obrien of the queensland university of technology law school says the revised laws profess but essentially fail to keep track with developing technologies and emerging markets it doesnt look like theyre very radical at all he says they seem fairly conservative he says the new laws will let people tape their favourite tv show or download music onto their mp players but he says they wont make life any easier for the creators of socalled internet and video mashups which combine content from a number of different sources to produce something new obrien who has coauthored a paper called mashups remixes and copyright law published on the university website says most mashups made by unauthorised use of copyright material will remain illegal under the proposed laws mashups are an example of remix culture which has roots in the postmodern tendency to cannibalise texts from various sources and is being driven by technology that makes this easier to do than ever before for example a website could combine music from one source with images from another source and a search function from somewhere else mashups are common in music videos and websites for example pop star kylie minogue has used legal mashups in her music videos while the website chicagocrime mixes police data with google maps meanwhile the ispecies search links data from genbank academic literature from google scholar and images from yahoo image search the challenge is the extent to which mashup and remix artists should be allowed to borrow in a seamless manner from the past to create the future obrien writes in his paper for the first time in history creativity is subject to regulation professor matthew rimmer an expert in copyright law at the australian national university agrees the proposed laws dont do much to address issues in the latest technologies he says the changes go some way to recognising the use of copyright works for critique and humour but its not a carte blanche he says obrien says its disappointing that the reforms didnt include an openended fair use clause which would be one way of mashup artists and others using copyright material legally creative commons and mashup guilds one way to address restrictions placed on mashup artists is through the concept of a creative common says jessica coates of the creative commons project run from queensland university of technology under the concept artists can license their work for use in certain ways including a mashup the idea is that licences can be used by owners to make their work more widely available coates says if youre trying to do innovation in a digital realm it can be very hard because youre using reproductions all the time so the idea with a creative common licence is to try to get material out into the common realm as long as it isnt used for commercial purposes mashup guilds are another solution says obrien mashup artists can form guilds to protect themselves against copyright holders who threaten to sue them he says its the idea that if they form a group they can try and counterbalance the threat of litigation testing the bounds rimmer says mashup artists may enjoy operating on the fringes of the law one reason that mashups have attracted such interest and popular acclaim is that they partly depend on the illegality they depend on breaching the normal controls he says there are always going to be people who dont seek permission and theres always going to be an innovative culture going on beyond the limits of the law a draft bill including the reforms will be released shortly the government says the ability to plan for the future has been around for at least million years scientists say when the apes shared a common ancestor apes plan for the future according to new research that questions whether humans are the only animals to think ahead german research published today in the journal science says apes can choose an appropriate tool to reach a treat and save the tool for the future instead of using it immediately the researchers from the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology say that planning for future not just current needs is one of the most formidable human cognitive achievements this is because it imposes a long delay between performing an action and being rewarded for it the researchers let bonobo chimpanzees and orangutans select tools to reach grapes and juice bottles they chose appropriate tools half of the time took them to their sleeping rooms then used them up to hours later when retrieving the treats both species show the skill the researchers say suggesting it evolved at least million years ago when all great ape species shared a common ancestor our results suggest that future planning is not a uniquely human ability contradicting the notion that it emerged in hominids only within the past to million years they write first evidence of its kind associate professor thomas suddendorf a psychologist from australias university of queensland says this is the first published evidence that apes save tools for future use suddendorf who comments on the study in the same issue of science says the findings also give a glimpse of our evolutionary past and provide a starting point from which researchers can begin to reconstruct the evolution of the human mind the fact that such simple performance of great apes is exciting reminds us how special and precious our foresight really is it is so common that we take it for granted he says but he says there is no evidence yet that apes can anticipate a future mental state for example there is no evidence they can anticipate being thirsty when theyre not currently thirsty how about other animals scrub jays birds found in the americas are animals that also plan for the future the scientists say these birds move their food around to decrease the chance of it being stolen suddendorp says some species that appear to be planning for the futures say by building nests or hoarding food are actually using instinctive behaviour or associative learning two miners walk free from a tasmanian goldmine after being trapped a kilometre underground highlighting the dangers of mine work australian researchers are developing a computerised system that monitors the performance of miners and tells management if workers are getting tired the system designed to improve safety for haul truck operators will be discussed at the national conference of the cooperative research centres association this week shortly after the beaconsfield mining disaster in northern tasmania in which one miner was killed and two others were trapped for two weeks university of sydney phd student stewart worrell who is being funded by crcmining says the sensing device wouldnt have made a difference in the beaconsfield rockfall because fatigue wasnt an issue but he says the goldmine accident which took the life of miner larry knight and trapped his workmates brant webb and todd russell highlights the danger of working in mines worrell says the technology is all about fatigue management he says fatigue statistics are underreported but us figures for show there are eight fatiguerelated fatalities in mines each year he says the system uses sensors fitted to the trucks and analyses data collected during haul operations like the ability of the driver to keep to a straight line and driver speed we have sensors attached to trucks which can monitor the trucks position on the road and detect when other trucks and vehicles are nearby he says the software analyses how a drivers performance changes over the duration of the shift and from there we can determine when there are threats and alert the driver we can detect if the trucks driving off the road or if theres a potential collision we might say this guys driven over the centre of the road a couple of times so its time to have a break data stored on each truck is also automatically downloaded to a central database when the haul truck returns to the dropoff area there its filtered and refined and the statistics are reported to mining management which can then use the information to upgrade safety or predict the impact of any planned changes the system is already in place in two west australian mines and other operations in australia and internationally are considering taking it up worrell says he says the technology is particularly suited to a mining environment which tends to be in an enclosed area but its also being considered for train drivers maritime enthusiasts tried to relive captain cooks voyage to the pacific in a replica of his ship endeavour but the replica ran aground in botany bay in april the day before it was due to sail into sydney harbour the ship is pictured here sitting at the garden island naval dock awaiting repairs captain james cooks endeavour the th century ship he sailed on his epic voyage to australia may be one of the four shipwrecks found off the coast of the us archaeologists say the ship is among four from a british fleet used during the us revolutionary war found off rhode island researchers with the rhode island marine archaeology project say they believe the ships and two others previously discovered are part of a vessel transport fleet intentionally sunk by the british in newport harbor in to keep french ships from landing to aid the americans drive for independence the archaeologists says one of the ships in the sunken british fleet was the lord sandwich which records show was once the endeavour the vessel cook used to sail the pacific ocean map new zealand and survey the eastern coast of australia in cook acknowledged by historians as one of the greatest navigators of all time is credited with surveying australias east coast on the endeavour expedition archaeologists say it is unclear which ship could be the endeavour seven of the ships in the british fleet have not been found but they say the latest find raises the chances that one of the discovered ships is the endeavour there is a chance that we have our hands on the endeavour says dk abbass executive director of the rhode island marine archaeology project a nonprofit organisation devoted to studying the states maritime history she adds it is unlikely anything on the ships would provide a direct link to cook quite frankly we could be working on her right now and never be able to prove it abbass says it may take years to fully investigate the shipwrecks found so far abbass says using historical materials and sonar the archaeologists discovered the ships in narragansett bay about about a kilometre off newport divers found ballast piles about to metres underwater with the ships keel and other parts embedded in the sea floor they also found at least one cannon an anchor with a metre shank and a creamcoloured fragment of an th century british ceramic teapot historically the finding is significant because it helps tell the story of the siege of newport marking frances first attempt to aid the american insurrection against the british though the effort failed leaders from each side george washington representing the americans and comte de rochambeau for americas french allies met in newport two years later to formalise their cooperation for subsequent battles the french ultimately helped the americans entrap british forces on a peninsula at yorktown virginia so what you have here is the british are geared up for the colonial rebellion and now theyre looking at an international conflict says rod mather an associate professor of maritime history and underwater archaeology at the university of rhode island the shipwrecks are rhode island property abbass says there are no plans to raise them officials estimate more than two dozen ships from the revolutionary war period lie beneath rhode islands waters they include british royal navy frigates vessels from the continental navy and a french ship benzene forms when vitamin c and a preservative combine in the can reports of benzene in soft drinks have been confirmed in australia by government authorities who say the levels pose no health risk a spokesperson for food standards australia and new zealand fsanz says a recent study has found levels of benzene in australian soft drinks are under parts per billion these levels are very very low the spokesperson says five years ago we wouldnt even have been able to detect it fsanz says the main source of benzene exposure for the general population is traffic pollution air round petrol stations and active and passive smoking the spokesperson says someone would need to drink more than litres of a drink to consume an amount of benzene equal to the amount breathed from city air in a day its an exceedingly small amount he says we dont believe it poses a health hazard but he says any amount of benzene in food is undesirable and fsanz is working with softdrink manufacturers to find ways of reducing levels to a minimum vitamin c preservative benzene benzene a carcinogen is found in the environment from natural and manmade sources fsanz says soft drinks containing ascorbic acid and the preservative sodium benzoate identified as have traces of benzene ascorbic acid reacts with copper and iron found in water to from hydroxyl radicals and these radicals can react with benzoic acid to form low levels of benzene says fsanz the world health organization guideline for benzene in drinking water is parts per billion and the us environmental protection agency has established a guidelines level in drinking water of parts per billion fsanz plans to release a fact sheet on benzene in soft drinks on its website within a week to days chemical mixtures dr kate hughes a sydneybased consultant on toxics to government and other organisations says the response from fsanz is disappointing it doesnt really matter whether its parts per billion or whatever says hughes a former toxics campaigner the point is its there and its not meant to be there in a food she says studies by us scientists have shown that a mixture of small amounts of chemicals in the food chain affect the development of children hughes says that it s also significant that the presence of benzene is an unanticipated reaction between a food additive and vitamin c she says it points to the creation of something that can be more toxic than the original two chemicals hughes says although there are now thousands of published examples of such synergistic reactions health authorities do not generally consider them in the real world hazardous chemicals usually dont come by themselves they usually come in mixtures says hughes given a choice goats like the taste of truffles onions apples and garlic but when faced with oranges like these ones on the greek island of crete they just cant refuse goats and sheep prefer the taste of truffles according to a new study that shows these ruminants have a wide palate with some suprising favourite flavours the study published in the may issue of the journal small ruminant research found that while sheep and goats have similar tastes sheep have a more discriminating palate flavour does appear to be more important to sheep than to goats says australian coauthor and csiro sustainable ecosystems researcher professor iain gordon we didnt test why this is the case but it may be because goats generally have a more catholic varied diet than do sheep in the natural world and so will eat a range of things with different flavours in order of preference sheep enjoy truffle garlic onion apple caramel maple and orange flavours according to the new research goats prefer truffle onion apple and garlic gordon and his colleagues recruited male scottish blackface sheep ovis aries and male feral hybrid goats capra hircus as taste testers the researchers treated nutritionallyenhanced food pellets with a range of synthetic humangrade flavourings avoiding the bitter flavours goats and sheep tend to dislike after the animals fasted for an hour the researchers presented basins containing the flavoured feeds for minutes by weighing each basin at the end of the taste test the researchers determined how much food of each flavour the ruminants ate taking the taste test both sheep and goats chowed down on the more pungent earthy flavoured feeds shunning strawberries my view regarding these flavours is that they are highly attractive even though rare because of health affects associated with consumption for example antiparasitic action on worms for garlic and onion says gordon he also explains that the researchers did not give real truffles onions and other foods associated with the flavours to the animals because they wanted to study the animals preferences for flavours alone independent of nutritional content dr alan duncan a nutritional ecologist at the macaulay institute in aberdeen scotland says the flavour rankings make sense both species tended to prefer flavours they might naturally encounter such as the fungitype truffle flavour and the onion and garlic flavours which are found in the wild representatives of both cultivated vegetables he says the fruity flavours tended to be avoided and this is unsurprising since fruits do not generally feature in the repertoire of natural foods encountered by ruminant herbivores i was slightly surprised that sheep showed stronger preferences than goats sheep are predominantly a grazing animal whereas goats readily consume shrubs and woody vegetation now that these preferences are known gordon and duncan suggest the flavours might be added to feed to encourage livestock to eat particularly when new foods are introduced we had sex with you no our early ancestors interbred with chimpanzees after the two species drew apart millions of years ago a new paper suggests the provocative idea is sketched by us genome experts who have discovered that hominids and chimps diverged far more recently and over a much longer timescale than anyone had thought during this time the authors theorise the two primates were rather more than kissing cousins they had sex swapping genes before making a final separation the analysis revealed big surprises with major implications for human evolution says professor eric lander director of the broad institute of harvard university and the massachusetts institute of technology and coauthor of the paper in todays issue of the journal nature until now the belief was that humans and chimpanzees shared a common ancestor but went their separate ways around million years ago the basis for this is a carbondated fossil called toumai whose supporters say is the oldest known human its critics though dismiss toumai as an ape the estimate is also backed by the molecular clock a method of calculating evolution on the basis of the speed at which genes mutate previous molecularclock studies have focused on the average genetic difference between human and chimp but the new paper takes a different approach looking at dna exploiting the mountain of data that has come from the human and chimpanzee genome projects the researchers compared the genetic codes of the two species as they are today they then estimated the various age of key sequences rather than the overall average they believe that the two species made their split no later than million years ago and probably less than million years ago in other words around to million years earlier than the toumai estimate moreover speciation of chimp and hominid the process by which they emerged as separate species took an extraordinary long time around four million years in all the youngest chromosome in the human genome is the x which helps determine gender on average x is around million years more recent than the nonsex chromosomes the scientists found lander describes xs tender age as an evolutionary smoking gun sex chromososmes previous studies suggest that sex chromosomes are among the most vulnerable of chromosomes when it comes to interbreeding this is because comingling places its genes under swift selective pressure thus something unusual must have happened on the way to speciation an initial split between human and chimp followed by interbreeding whose results show up in progressive younger genes and then a final separation lead author dr nick patterson also at the broad institute says that toumais claimed status as humans ancestor has been somewhat clouded it is possible that the toumai fossil is more recent than previously thought but if the dating is correct it would precede the humanchimp split he says the fact that it has humanlike features suggest that humanchimp speciation may have occurred over a long period with episodes of hybridisation interbreeding between the emerging species a gradual divergence of species through hybridisation rather than a quick break may be far more common than we suspect that such evolutionary events have not been seen more often in animal species may simply be due to the fact that we have not been looking for them says the teams senior author assistant professor david reich also of the broad institute the last human chromosome to be sequenced chromosome is the biggest and contains the most genes scientists have reached a landmark point in one of the worlds most important scientific projects by sequencing the last chromosome in the human genome chromosome contains nearly twice as many genes as the average chromosome and makes up of the human genetic code it is packed with genes and linked to illnesses including cancer alzheimers and parkinsons disease according to a report today in the journal nature this achievement effectively closes the book on an important volume of the human genome project says dr simon gregory who headed the sequencing project at the uks sanger institute the project started in to identify the genes and dna sequences that provide a blueprint for human beings chromosome is the biggest and contains per chromosome the greatest number of genes therefore it is the region of the genome to which the greatest number of diseases have been localised adds gregory the sequence of chromosome took an international team of scientists years to complete researchers around the world will be able to mine the data to improve diagnostics and treatments for cancers autism mental disorders and other illnesses final chapter the human genome has about to genes and the sequencing of chromosome has led to the identification of more than new ones we are moving into the next phase which will be working out what the genes do and how they interact says gregory the genetic map of chromosome has already been used to identify a gene for a common form of cleft lip and palate it will also improve understanding of what processes lead to genetic diversity in populations gregory says the scientists also identified new snps single nucleotide polymorphisms variations in human dna that make people unique snps contain clues about why some people are susceptible to diseases like cancer or malaria the best way to diagnose and treat them and how they will respond to drugs could the hobbit really be one of us after all scientists who argue the hobbit is really just a modern human with a small brain have published evidence for the first time in a major scientific journal todays issue of the journal science carries a paper led by primate evolution expert dr bob martin of the field museum in chicago which says homo floresiensis is likely to have been a modern human who suffered from microcephaly a condition that causes a small brain this reignites the debate about whether the remains of the small hominid from the indonesian island of flores is really h sapiens or a dwarf version of h erectus that evolved after becoming isolated on the island as was originally suggested martins team says that based on standard models of dwarfing the hobbits brain size is way too small to be that of a dwarf it also argues the tools found alongside the hobbit are far too advanced to have been made by anyone but h sapiens if you look at the history of stone tools around the world homo erectus never made tools like that says martin ive been in this business for years and i really smell a rat in this he says i dont think the standard story can be right and people are eventually going to see this his team also rejects findings of a study published last year that found the brain of h floresiensis was unlike that of a microcephalic human martin says the study led by brain evolution expert professor dean falk of florida state university compared the hobbit with only one microcephalic which he now says is a child when the researchers should have been comparing it with a microcephalic adult martins team describes the brains of two adult microcephalic specimens a male from india and a female from lesotho it says are similar to the hobbits planetary system around the star hd with its three neptunesized planets and an asteroid belt scientists looking for planets around stars beyond the sun have found a system that contains an asteroid belt and three neptunesized worlds one of which orbits in a zone where liquid surface water could exist although the planets location could theoretically support life researchers believe it is wrapped in an extensive hydrogen atmosphere and probably not suitable for life as we know it nevertheless the finding which is reported in the latest issue of the issue nature is considered a key development in the continuing push to find earthlike worlds elsewhere in the universe the trio of planets circle hd a pale sunlike star about lightyears away in the constellation puppis astronomers using the infrared spitzer space telescope previously discovered that hd probably has an asteroid belt in orbit if true the star would be the first similar in mass and age to the sun to have one the researchers also predicted that a planets gravitational tug was helping to keep the belt in order with that hint and a sophisticated lightsplitting spectrograph on the european space agencys metre telescope in la silla in chile astronomers spent two years studying miniscule wobbles in the stars orbit through the telescope they found three planets orbiting within the same distance that earth orbits the sun surprisingly the hunt turned up no sign of a large jupiterclass planet making hd the first extrasolar planetary system without a massive planet the planetary system around hd clearly represents a rosetta stone in our understanding of how planets form says coauthor professor michel mayor a swiss astronomer from the observatory of geneva no doubt it will help us better understand the huge diversity we have observed since the first extrasolar planet was found years ago hunting for more planets although hd s planets are still to times bigger than earth the discovery is encouraging to researchers who are refining their planethunting techniques to find smaller more earthlike worlds it implies that further lowmass planets will be spotted orbiting other stars writes harvard university astronomer professor david charbonneau in a related article in nature computer simulations indicate the innermost planet is probably rocky like earth the middle one is a combination of rock and gas and the outer planet which is the one predicted to lie in the zone of habitability is estimated to have a rockyice core and a massive envelope of gas researchers believe the system is stable blowflies have an inbuilt natural resistance to some organophosphate insecticides scientists show scientists have used crushed fly legs that are years old to solve the riddle of why insects evolve rapid resistance to pesticides dna extracted from the fly legs shows that australian sheep blowflies have an existing advantageous genetic characteristic that allows them to resist certain insecticides the research features online today in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences blowflies have long created headaches for australian sheep farmers because they lay their eggs in faecal matter around the sheeps tail causing blowfly strike the pesticide diazinon was introduced into australia in the s as a sheep dip to combat the problem but within six years blowflies developed a high level of resistance to it researchers from csiro entomology in canberra and collaborators from new zealand and the uk wanted to see if the blowflies had a preadaptation resistance to the insecticide this would explain why they developed resistance so rapidly to do this csiros dr carol hartley and colleagues gathered samples kept at the australian national insect collection of yearold blowfly legs from two australian sheep blowflies lucilia cuprina and its close relative l sericata they then crushed them and extracted their dna the researchers compared the state of blowflies resistance genes before and after the introduction of the pesticide we didnt find any diazinon resistance in the old fly legs whereas it occurs in the present day species that tells us that in the case of the diazinon pesticide there was no preadaptation but when the researchers conducted the same experiment with another pesticide malathion they found resistance genes both in the old blowflies and the modern blowflies showing there was preexisting resistance this is evidence for preadaptation as a mechanism of evolution of insecticide resistance says hartley she says it is this preexisting resistance that let resistance to organophosphate insecticides take off so rapidly the specific diazinon resistance gene developed later we used the dna from the very old flies to show that one form of the alteration already existed in the flies from years ago long before they had ever been exposed to the organophosphate chemicals hartley says it was this that allowed the flies to rapidly develop resistance to the organophosphate chemicals in general after which the better version of the mutation took over in the flies she says while the research mainly tells us about the mechanism of evolution and how it occurred in these particular blowfly species it also gives a clue to why rapid evolution of resistance can occur this might help researchers predict potential insecticide resistance in the future she says shampoos sunscreens toothpastes antiaging creams and other personal care products contain nanomaterials a new report says consumers are using cosmetics

nanometres across and manufacturers are not required to label products containing them there is some concern among scientists that such tiny particles may have toxic characteristics yet there is limited scientific information available on their safety among their concerns are whether creams and lotions containing nanoparticles can penetrate deep into the skin skin deep the therapeutic goods administration tga which regulates sunscreens in australia says the weight of current evidence is that nanoparticles used in sunscreens stay on the surface or in the outer dead layer of the skin but miller points to the uks royal society which says the ability of nanoparticles to penetrate into the skin is still unclear existing studies are inadequate says miller which is why there are numerous studies on skin penetration being carried out in the us and europe we think the tgas conclusion is very premature and irresponsible says miller some manufacturers promote deeper skin penetration as a feature of their nanoparticleenhanced products she says pointing to antiageing wrinkle creams that contain fullerenes nanoscale carbon spheres they are promoting their use of fullerenes as a positive attribute because they claim that fullerenes enable much deeper penetration into the skin of the antiageing ingredients she says in a lot of instances its the very properties that are attractive to cosmetics manufacturers for example the ability to penetrate deeper in the skin that are of concern to us she says a us scientific study found fullerenes can cause brain damage in fish kill water fleas and are toxic to human liver cells even in low doses cosmetics regulator welcomes report deborah willcocks of the national industrial chemicals notification and assessment nicnas which regulates cosmetics in australia says her organisation is particularly pleased to see the foe report she says nicnas called on industry in february this year to provide data on what nanomaterials were being used and in what volume the friends of the earth report is the first time weve actually seen some published information on what products might be on the market out there she says its a good help to us willcocks says more data is required before nicnas can determine if nanomaterials have unique toxicological properties compared ito materials with a larger particle size she says nicnas is meeting with its industry committee today and is proposing to set up a working group with industry and the community to develop a strategy on how to deal with nanomaterials we are concerned thats why were actually working on this very actively willcocks says the body representing australias cosmetics industry accord australasia says it has only just become aware of the foe report executive director bronywn capanna says accord and its member companies would cooperate with the regulatory agencies should the report raise any relevant significant issues she says examples of nanotechnology used in cosmetics and personal care products include nanoemulsions nanopigments and sunblocks and nanocapsules calls for a moratorium the uks royal society recommends nanoparticles be tested and assessed as new chemicals but regulators say it is too early to say whether specific safety tests are required meanwhile foe is seeking a moratorium on the production and sale of products containing nanomaterials our call is for a halt to the further release of products that contain nanomaterials until such time as we have done the safety assessment and weve got regulations in place to manage the risks miller says the public health association of australia supports foes call for a moratorium there is also no surveillance going on to see if anything does arise out of the use of nanotechnology in things like cosmetics and sunscreens says executive director pieta laut fossil tracks left by mediumsized wading birds the depth and condition of the tracks indicate that the substrate was still very wet when these birds walked on the surface scientists have found what they say is the first evidence of prehistoric wading birds probing for food the depressions and footprints were found at alaskas denali national park and preserve in rocks scientists say were formed from freshwater sediments million to million years ago such evidence of prehistoric birds feeding behaviour is difficult to find because the marks made in the mud disappear easily and the fossilised evidence often erodes says phil brease a geologist at the park geologists discovered the tracks and marks last year at first they thought they were impressions left by raindrops but after studying photographs and moulds they determined they were depressions left by birds beaks the scientists say the depth and condition of the marks suggests the area was still very wet when the birds walked on the surface they presented their findings at a recent geological society of america conference in anchorage denali national park is emerging to be a rich source of fossils a team of geologists has also discovered a fossilised footprint of a threetoed meateating dinosaur this theropod would have roamed the area about million years ago the scientists say glowing plasma inside a fusion test reactor physicists say they have cracked a problem facing nuclear fusion touted as the cheap safe clean and almost limitless energy source of the future the us researchers say they have found a way to cut down erosion of the metal reactor wall which would be a crucial step to improving efficiency they publish their work online today in the journal nature physics in fusion atomic nuclei are fused together to release energy as opposed to fission the technique used for nuclear power and atomic bombs where nuclei are split in a fusion reactor particles are rammed together to form the charged gas plasma contained inside a doughnutshaped chamber called a tokamak by powerful magnetic coils a consortium of countries signed a deal last year to build the international thermonuclear experimental reactor iter in southern france as a testbed for an eventual commercial design but many experts have been shaking their heads at the many challenges facing the iter designers one challenge has been the phenomenon of edge localised modes or elms sudden fluxes or eddies in the outer edge of the plasma that erode the reaction chambers inner wall the tokamaks inner wall is an expensive metal skin that absorbs neutrons emitted from the plasma and erosion would mean that the wall would have to be replaced more often eroded particles also have a big impact on the plasma performance diminishing the amount of energy it can deliver a team led by todd evans of general atomics california believes that the problematic elms can be cleverly controlled the scientists found that a small resonant magnetic field derived from special coils located inside a reactor vessel creates chaotic magnetic interference on the plasma edge which stops the fluxes from forming the experiments were conducted at the general atomics diiid national fusion facility a tokamak in san diego nuclear fusion is the same process used by the sun to radiate energy in the case of our star hydrogen atoms are forced together to produce helium on earth the fusion would take place in a reactor fuelled by two istopes of hydrogen deuterium and tritium with helium as the waste product deuterium is present in seawater which would make it a virtually limitless resource tritium would be derived from irradiating the plentiful element lithium in the fusion vessel the us billion a billion iter scheme entails building the largest tokamak in the world at cadarache near the southern french city of marseille the partners are the european union the us japan russia china india and south korea it is designed to be a testbed of fusion technologies with a construction period of about years and an operational lifespan of years if iter works a prototype commercial reactor would be built and if that works fusion technology would be rolled out across the world other problems facing fusion technology include the challenge of creating a selfsustaining plasma and efficiently containing the plasma so that charged particles do not leak out in existing tokamaks no one has achieved a selfsustaining fusion event for longer than about five seconds and at the cost of using up far more energy than is yielded a huge jolt of heat of nearly milliondegc is needed to kickstart the process which then has to be sustained by tiny amounts of fuel pellets todays satellite is tomorrows space junk but is it worth preserving plans to springclean space junk orbiting earth could result in the loss of irreplaceable historical artefacts an archaeologist warns dr alice gorman of flinders university in adelaide an australian researcher who has previously called for space junk to be world heritage listed is on a mission to preserve what she says are heritage items in space she plans to take that mission to the australian space development conference in canberra in july and to the world archaeological congress in jamaica next year gorman says as space agencies prepare to declutter potentially dangerous space junk its time to assess the value of some of the millions of objects currently orbiting earth there are a number of proposals being put forth by a number agencies and space junk is recognised as a very serious problem says gorman who is cochair of the world archaeological congress space heritage taskforce theres a window of time now where we can plan to do it right culling the clutter space junk ranges from tiny scraps just millimetres in size to whole satellites nasa the european space agency and some private organisations are already developing plans to remove it gorman says while some space junk undergoes an automatic cleanup regime by burning up when it reenters the atmosphere other items need to be physically removed current proposals include using groundbased lasers to put objects off orbit and speed the rate of their burnup sending out space tugs as roving garbage collectors or using tethers to rope and haul in bits of space debris to make that effective you have to be able to discriminate between whats junk and whats not gorman says among the items that should recognised for their heritage value are the vanguard one satellite launched in and the oldest human object in space and fedsat the australian designed and built satellite preserving items like these could provide evidence of a nations presence in space or help reconstruct a history of space exploration she says woomera gorman will present a report on the management of space junk at the world archaeological congress next may it will outline the heritage of space exploration what mechanisms exist to manage space junk legal boundaries and which sites might be considered part of that heritage she says one of those sites is woomera in south australia which she says played a part in a bygone era in australia and in terms of the development of space exploration it has a much more than local significance she says scarecrows have moved away from the veggie patch hitech scarecrows are now scaring birds away from fish farms with help from the web and a mobile phone a computerised scarecrow could be the next defence against unwanted birds its us developers say the intelligent scarecrow designed by computer science and engineering students at the university of south florida in tampa uses a computer an internet camera and imaging software to detect birds around fish ponds in response the scarecrow makes loud noises or powerful bursts of water to scare the birds away fish farmers go to great lengths and sometimes expense to keep fisheating birds at bay deterrents include everything from tethered balloons netting and birdchasing dogs to propane cannons pyrotechnics and motionsensitive sprinklers but most methods dont work well are expensive or loud the intelligent scarecrow is dressed in like an american football player with helmet and baggy jersey but it is brains not brawn that make it a threat the helmet conceals an internetenabled videocamera that takes in a wide field of view which can be accessed via a website a microprocessor with image processing software the students wrote scans for colour and shape differences between frames if the software sees bright orange it will not trigger a response so a farmer wearing a bright orange vest can tend crops without being seen as a threat but other changes trigger sprinklers to the right and left of the scarecrow to shoot out powerful jets of water up to metres blasting the birds the device can also blast loud sounds such as a shotgun noise or the cry of a predatory hawk through nearby speakers and because its internetenabled the scarecrow can send a text message to a mobile phone or an email to a computer alerting the farmer of threats as far as the bird is concerned this thing is intelligent says associate professor ken christensen who oversaw the students development of the intelligent scarecrow but the scarecrow may have a long way to go before it stands post over a pond says craig watson director of the tropical research laboratory at the university of florida in ruskin the area it would cover is not practical with a to acre fish farm he says and unless the scarecrow can move around regularly the birds will become accustomed to it and no longer see it as a threat christensen and his students are now working to extend the scarecrows predator detection range and waterspraying accuracy and range solar roof tiles would provide an alternative to conventional solar panel systems a roof tile that harnesses solar energy to heat water and generate electricity has been invented by an australian industrial designer the plastic tile is filled with solar cells and connects to a houses hot water system and electrical wiring sebastian braat a graduate of the university of western sydney says the tiles are designed with urban dwellings in mind particularly the new generation of socalled mcmansion style suburban homes my project is focussing on getting the technology into the city and easing the power burden our housing estates are rapidly creating he says the tiles consist of a clear polycarbonate chassis containing a water vessel and photovoltaic cells the tiles can be manufactured to match a variety of roof tile styles between and of thermal energy that hits the cells is converted into electricity the remainder is used to heat the water braat says he runs a coolant through the water in the tiles which goes to a heat exchanger the heat exchanger transfers the heat to a regular hot water storage tank creating an energy surplus meanwhile the solar cells generate electricity as direct current that goes to an inverter connected to the houses power box which remains connected to the electricity grid the idea of being grid connected is that you generate loads more power than you need during the day and that gets fed back into the grid he says that means the house in effect is generating its own power and generating the excess into the grid if the house uses more than it generates the user gets charged if not they get a credit from the power company how many tiles does it take braat says it takes about tiles to generate a maximum of kilowatts more than enough for an average threebedroom suburban house over a year dr dong chen a research scientist with csiro manufacturing and infrastructure technology who wasnt involved in the design says it makes sense to use roof tiles or any exposed parts of a house for solar heating he says braat may need to look at how efficient the tiles are and the pitch of the roof may affect this chen says the inventor will also need to look at the cost of the tiles including their maintenance and how safe they are he says its also possible the roof could leak because the tiles may involve a number of small joints artificial sweeteners accelerate the emptying of the stomach and increase the rate at which alcohol is absorbed alcoholic drinks made with artificial sweeteners lead to a high rate of alcohol absorption resulting in a greater blood alcohol concentration than from drinks made with sugarbased mixers a new study has found the reason according to an australian team led by dr chris rayner of the royal adelaide hospital is the accelerated emptying of the stomach caused by artificial sweetening agents rayner presented his teams research at this weeks digestive disease week meeting in los angeles today more and more people are shifting personal preferences by choosing diet drinks as a healthier alternative says rayner what people do not understand is the potential side effects that diet mixed alcoholic drinks may have on their bodys response to alcohol rayner and team studied eight healthy male volunteers on one day the subjects consumed an orangeflavoured vodka drink made from alcohol and a mixer sweetened with sugar containing calories on the second day the men drank the same amount of alcohol with a diet mixer containing calories the researchers measured the rate of stomach emptying using ultrasound technology and took blood samples at minute intervals for three hours the time to empty half of the diet drink from the stomach was minutes compared to regular drinks which took minutes for the same degree of emptying peak blood alcohol concentrations were substantially greater with diet drinks at an average of while regular drinks measured at blood alcohol concentration it was surprising how much of a difference the artificial sweetener made rayner says rayner says these drinks also tend to be consumed at times other than meal times when food would slow gastric emptying he recommends that product labelling include information on the intoxicating qualities of artificially sweetened alcoholic drinks there could be legal implications for those driving home as well he notes before the big bang could have been a previous universe a lot like our own that first collapsed and then inflated into the universe we have today the big bang may have been a big bounce say theorists searching for what preceded the birth of our own universe if their new mathematical simulations are correct what came before the big bang was a previous universe a lot like our own it collapsed on itself then some weird physics caused it to inflate into the universe we have today physicist dr abhay ashtekar of pennsylvania state university and team publish their results in a recent issue of physical review letters what has blocked the prebig bang view from theoreticians was the mathematical expression of what was happening based on certain assumptions about spacetime the problem was the calculations kept ramming up against infinity when that happens equations fail its like having an impenetrable wall says ashtekar when it comes to infinity we cannot in physics go beyond it spacetime is a model that combines threedimensional space and onedimensional time into a single unit called the spacetime continuum in this continuum time is considered the fourth dimension what was becoming infinite in scientists calculations was the curvature of the spacetime continuum as you near the time when everything in the universe and all the gravity was concentrated into a single point gravity shreds fabric of spacetime the prebig bang gravity basically shredded the spacetime fabric and left only the physics of atoms quantum physics to work with to peer into that unimaginable crush ashtekar and colleagues started gain without assuming that the fabric of spacetime continuum existed in the earliest moments of the universe the general belief is that the continuum may be just an approximation says ashtekar this is something even einstein said instead the team applied whats called loop quantum gravity a strategy that has been developed to join quantum physics with einsteins general relativity quantum theory suggests big crunch according to loop quantum gravity the fabric of space is made of discrete and identical onedimensional quantum threads at the big bang the fabric is a shredded mess and only these threads can be followed further back using this concept the researchers concluded that a previous universe collapsed in on itself in a gigantic gravitational big crunch then when the density of that crunch reached super astronomical values gravity flipped into a repulsive force another weird outcome of this physics and inflated the new universe in which we live its long been speculated that as you get to the big bang quantum theory was going to be important says physicist dr jorge pullin of louisiana state university its also been speculated that if you could work out the equations youd probably see that the big bang was a big bounce he says but this is the first time that anyone has actually done a thorough job working through the physics back through the big bang he says previous universe elusive as for what it tells us about the previous universe its not much says pullin the only thing you can conclude is that the bounce occurs he says thats not to say we will never learn more about the earlier universe astronomers are discovering patterns in the cosmic background radiation that appear to be the inflated remnants of electronsized irregularities in the first instant of the big bang could those irregularities combined with loop quantum gravity reveal patterns inherited from the earlier universe there may be certain hints left behind says pullin the biological clock ticks for both men as well as women a mans fertility appears to decline after the age of in much the same way that a womans ability to conceive fades after say french researchers dr elise de la rochebrochard and team from the french national health institute inserm report their findings in the may issue of the journal fertility and sterility their study of nearly couples undergoing fertility treatment found that pregnancy attempts were more likely to fail when the man was age or older than if he were younger than regardless of his wifes age as an increasing number of couples choose to postpone childbearing they should be informed that paternal age over years is an important risk factor for failure to conceive say de la rochebrochard and team because all the women in the study were completely sterile and undergoing in vitro fertilisation ivf the age of the fathers was key and while past studies have suggested that older men are less likely to father children the extent to which this was related to biological changes or to decreased sexual activity has been unclear our results provide for the first time strong evidence for a paternal age effect on failure to conceive that is linked only to biological male ageing the researchers say according to the researchers the lower ivf success rate among relatively older men may be due to poorerquality sperm it has long been known that women are less likely to conceive after the age of than before say the researchers but the current findings they say suggest that for men the age of is similarly important in reproduction the researchers conclude age must no longer be considered as the concern of the woman but as that of the couple the new research supports the idea that theres more to heredity than dna genetic instructions can be carried from one generation to the next in rna a mouse experiment by french researchers suggests dr minoo rassoulzadegan of the university of nice sophia antipolis and team report their findings in todays issue of the journal nature this is the first demonstration of rnainduced transmission of heredity rassoulzadegan says rna or ribonucleic acid is a singlestrand molecule that plays a key role in making proteins in animals by transferring and translating genetic information encoded in dna but rassoulzadegan and team have now found that it is capable of much more spotty mutant mice surprise scientists they engineered laboratory mice to have a variation in a gene called kit the variation gave the mice white spots on their tails the mice concerned had a mutant version and a normal version in the two copies of their kit gene the researchers crossed these heterozygous mice and examined the offspring some of the offspring had both copies of the normal kit genes yet remarkably they also had the white spots the researchers also found that the white spots were transmitted to the next generation of mice even though these rodents also had the normal genes a challenge to mendels laws the findings challenge the laws of inheritance set down in the th century by austrian monk gregor mendel according to these offspring can only get the genetic code exactly as it is handed on from their parents by all rights if the mice both had normal kit genes their tails should have been reassuringly spotless rassoulzadegan suggests the answer to this mystery lies in rna the mutant version of kit produces unexpectedly large numbers of aberrantlysized messenger rna she found in addition the sperm of mutant mice also surprisingly was found to have accumulations of rna intrigued by this her team injected rna from mutant cells into normal embryos and presto spottedtail mice were born rna carried in sperm acts as gene silencer the hypothesis is that rna is carried in the mouses sperm and at fertilisation it silences the activity of the normal kit gene this happens not only in the offspring but in subsequent generations too back in an american biologist called r alexander brink became the first to suggest paramutation in which an order issued by one set of genes was remembered in ensuing generations even though the gene itself was not subsequently handed on in reproduction but the phenomenon has only been seen in lab plants not in mammals in addition it occurs only very rarely apparently as a result of interaction between the two copies of a gene normally the pair of genes operate independently caution urged before rewriting rule book in a commentary on rassoulzadegans research also carried in nature dr paul soloway of cornell university new york stresses caution saying that her findings have to be replicated by others before mendels rule book has to be rewritten and he says the mechanism by which the transmitted rna works remains unclear but if the work is validated the way is open for a rethink on how rna could influence the transmision of heredity diseases metabolism and even types of imprinted behaviour from distant generations scientists have found the centre in the brain that controls your ability to wiggle your ears human ears can wiggle as well as produce their own sounds and now researchers have a better understanding of how these unusual processes work since ear wiggling involves complex coordination of facial muscles research on it could shed light on related disorders such as bells palsy which can cause facial paralysis the research into sounds made by the ear meanwhile is surprisingly illuminating when it comes to gender and sexuality issues it turns out heterosexual men and women and homosexual women appear to produce different levels of ear noise ear wiggling while most of us produce sound from our ears the ability to wiggle them in a controlled and detectable way is not as common the mechanism behind ear movements is sophisticated says bastiaan ter meulen who led the ear wiggling study accepted for publication in the journal clinical neurophysiology unlike other facial muscles ear muscles have their own accessory nucleus a control area for muscle function in the brainstem says ter meulen a researcher at erasmus mc a university medical centre in rotterdam the netherlands compared to animals especially bats and cats this nucleus is rather small in humans he says he says that a muscle involved in eye movement also directly controls ear motion thats why when we look left or right our ears slightly withdraw on both sides breathing and swallowing are also linked to ear movement through muscles and neuronal pathways ter meulen and team made these determinations after conducting an eeg or brain wave test on a yearold woman who lost consciousness and experienced rhythmic bursts of ear movement their study marks the first time such ear muscle activity has ever been documented in an eeg noisy ears another team of researchers analysed noises made by the inner ear that are like echoes that occur in response to clicks such as pencil tapping or distortion such as a bad radio signal dr dennis mcfadden a professor of psychology at the university of texas at austin and his colleagues measured the strength of these otoacoustic emissions or earproduced sounds in rhesus monkeys and spotted hyenas their studies have been accepted for publication in the journal hormones and behavior the scientists found that as for humans the sounds were stronger in females during the breeding season the differences between the male and female ear sounds became even more pronounced suggesting that hormones affect the emissions because male and female spotted hyenas are more androgynous when young the researchers expected that their otoacoustic emissions would be similar as predicted measurements of the echolike ear sounds obtained from nine male and seven female hyenas were similar sexual orientation factor in a prior study mcfadden found that the sounds produced in the inner ears of homosexual and bisexual women were weaker than those emitted from the ears of heterosexual women since men also exhibit weaker echolike sounds in the inner ear mdfadden says the results suggest the inner ear and some unknown brain structures may play a role in sexual preference the inner ear may be a valuable noninvasive window into events that occur during brain development and sexual differentiation he says researchers used chimp poop to confirm the origin of hiv the closest viral relative to hiv has been traced for the first time to wild chimpanzees confirming the theory that these creatures are the original source of aids a team led by dr beatrice hahn of the university of alabama at birmingham report their study of wild chimpanzees from southern cameroon in todays issue the journal science it says that the chimpanzee group that gave rise to hiv this chimp community resides in cameroon says hahn who has been studying the genetic origin of hiv for years in people hiv leads to aids but chimps have a version called simian immune deficiency virus siv that causes them no harm to date siv has been found in captive chimps but hahn wanted to show it could be found in the wild too her international team got the cooperation of the government in cameroon and they hired skilled trackers to locate the elusive chimps it is hard to track them says hahn but the trackers managed to collect samples of droppings from the chimpanzee subspecies pan troglodytes troglodytes hahns lab found viral dna and evidence of the virus itself in the droppings and estimated the prevalence of siv infection in the associated chimp populations we went to field sites and we found evidence of infection in five hahn says we were able to identify a total of infected chimps and we were able to get viral sequences from all of them widespread infection up to of the apes in some communities were infected with siv and different varieties or clades of the virus were found we found some of the clades were really really very closely related to the human virus and others were not says hahn she says chimps separated by a river were infected with different clades and a river may have carried the virus into the human population cameroon not the origin of the epidemic while siv has been found in cameroon the epidemic is known to have originated elsewhere the epidemic took off in kinshasa in brazzaville says hahn kinshasa is in the democratic republic of congo formerly zaire and faces brazzaville in congo across the congo river studies have traced hiv to a man who gave a blood sample in in kinshasa then called leopoldville so how do you get from southern cameroon to the democratic republic of congo hahn asks some human must have done so there is a river that goes from that southeastern corner of cameroon down to the congo river ivory and hardwood traders used the sangha river in the s when the original humantohuman transmission is believed to have happened transmission still a mystery hahns study suggests the virus passed from chimpanzees to people more than once we dont really know how these transmissions occurred hahn says we know that you dont get it from petting a chimp or from a toilet seat just like you cant get hiv from a toilet seat she says it requires exposure to infected blood and infected body fluids so if you get bitten by an angry chimp while you are hunting it that could do it hahn and teams study only applies to the hiv group m which is the main strain of the virus responsible for the aids pandemic it is quite possible that still other chimpanzee siv lineages exist that could pose risks for human infection and prove problematic for hiv diagnostics and vaccines hahn and team say aids was only identified years ago hiv now infects million people around the world and has killed million spread via blood sexual contact and from mother to child during birth or breastfeeding there is no vaccine against hiv although drug cocktails can help control it should the tropics move another two or three degrees poleward the sahara desert could shift perhaps several hundred kilometres towards the poles the researchers say the tropical regions of the world have been expanding since say us climatologists who say it is unclear whether the phenomenon is caused by global warming dr thomas reichler a meteorology professor at the university of utah in salt lake city and colleagues report their findings in todays issue of the journal science after analysing satellite temperature data collected between and researchers estimate that the tropics has expanded by two degrees of latitude or kilometres during that period its a big deal says reichler the tropics may be expanding and getting larger the phenomenon could explain the increase in droughts and decrease in precipitation observed in recent years in the subtropical regions of southwestern united states and europes mediterranean basin the scientists say the possible expansion of the tropics may be a totally new aspect of climate change reichler says we dont know for sure what triggered it besides global warming another possible cause is the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer due to pollutants such as refrigerant gases jet streams play a key role meteorologists generally consider that the tropics lies between degn and degs reichler and team found that in both hemispheres at these midlatitudes the lower atmosphere or troposphere has became warmer compared to other latitudes in the past years while the stratosphere has become cooler the researchers argue this change would have pushed each of the tropospheric jet streams fastmoving wind currents that propel weather patterns towards the poles the jet streams mark the edge of the tropics so if they are moving poleward that means the tropics are getting wider says study coauthor dr john wallace an atmospheric sciences professor at the university of washington in seattle he says movement of the jet streams will have longterm impact on rainfall should the tropics move another two or three degrees poleward in this century says wallace very dry areas such as the sahara desert could nudge farther toward the pole perhaps by a few hundred miles measurements reichler says the team used long satellite measurements of atmospheric temperatures to find the distinct pattern of warming weather balloons also provided independent confirmation of the satellite observation he says the researchers say the midlatitude tropospheric warming trend remained even after excluding the record midlatitude temperatures in caused by the el nino metamaterials could create the ultimate optical illusion invisibility although it wouldnt quite look like this new materials that can change the way light and other forms of radiation bend around an object may provide a way to make things invisible say researchers two separate teams of researchers report in todays issue the journal science that experimental metamaterials could be used to hide an object from visible light infrared light microwaves and perhaps even sonar probes their work suggests that sciencefiction portrayals of invisibility such as the cloaking devices used to hide space ships in star trek might be truly possible harry potters cloak or the invisible man of films and fiction might be a bit harder to emulate however because the thing to be made invisible will have to be encased in a thick shell of metamaterials metamaterials are composite structures that deliberately resemble nothing found in nature they are engineered to have unusual properties such as the ability to bend light in unique ways the metamaterial cloak would act like youve opened up a hole in space says dr david r smith a professor of electrical and computer engineering at duke university in north carolina and coauthor of one of the papers in science all light or other electromagnetic waves are swept around the area guided by the metamaterial to emerge on the other side as if they had passed through an empty volume of space unlike modern stealth bombers that bounce radar off their surfaces so they cannot be seen an object could be encased in a shell of metamaterials it would create an illusion akin to a mirage says coauthor dr david schurig also of duke university like all physics the invisibility idea requires a little imagination think of space as a woven cloth says shurig imagine making a hole in the cloth by inserting a pointed object between the threads without tearing them the light or microwaves or radar would travel along the threads of the cloth ending up behind the object without having touched it you just need the right set of material properties and you can guide light shurig says defence project the duke university researchers started working on metamaterials with a grant from the defense advanced research projects agency darpa such materials could provide superlight electronics in aircraft or cars or highly efficient lenses the researchers came up with the idea of using these materials to bend light and other electromagnetic radiation we are going to try to have an experimental demonstration of these effects there are a few more steps to go we are working on these steps says smith shurig says anyone making such a cloak would have to choose what form of radiation one wanted invisibility from also the invisibility would work both ways a person hidden from the visible light spectrum would have to use infrared or sonar or microwaves to see out he says if want to cover the whole visible spectrum that would a tall order says shurig a second paper in science by ukbased professor of theoretical physics dr ulf leonhardt at the university of st andrews also proposes an invisibility device using metamaterials light behaves in weird ways when you shine it through special materials light does something weird when you shift it into reverse scientists say it moves faster than the speed of light two research teams independently reported the counterintuitive behaviour observed in two very different experiments in a recent issue of the journal science this is just so mindboggling that it cries out for attention says professor robert boyd an optics expert at the university of rochester in new york he and his colleagues triggered the odd trick using optical fibre laced with the element erbium the same kind of fibre used in telecommunications they split a burst of laser light sending one beam through the optical fibre and allowing the other to travel without interference oddly enough the first beams peak exited the far end of the fibre way ahead of the peak of the comparison pulse odder still the exiting peak escaped even before the original peak had entered the fibre what had happened was that as soon as the leading edge of the original pulse entered the fibre the fibre instantly cloned an identical pulse at the far end that cloned peak exited before the rest of the original had been introduced at the same time another cloned pulse fired backward through the fibre to cancel out the original so ultimately one pulse entered and one emerged but with timing that appeared to violate lights natural speed limit to test if the pulse was travelling backward as it seemed the team shortened the fibre a few centimetres at a time and repeated the experiment by adding the experiments together in sequence they watched the beams backward progression the fibre itself they conclude instantly reconstructed the pulse at the far end simultaneously sending another pulse backward not once but twice german researchers made a similar observation in an independent experiment at the universitaumlt karlsruhe a team led by gunnar dolling sent a pulse of light through material whose unusual properties allow it to bend light in unexpected ways dolling and colleagues also witnessed the very same backward fasterthanlight behaviour as the rochester team the propagation of light waves through dispersive media often leads to surprising or counterintuitive behaviour report dolling and colleagues referring to dispersion as the ability of a material to separate light into different wavelengths or colours these and other experiments with weird light are suddenly possible because of new lightdispersive materials more sensitive technology to detect what light is doing and because optics researchers are simply paying more attention to the strange things light does in odd materials up until several years ago people were not familiar with the concepts of slow and fast light says boyd forensic jigsaw puzzle fungi are helping scientists to estimate the time of death deceased individuals supposedly push up daisies but a new study suggests human cadavers are more likely to support several species of white and yellow fungi the study is the first to describe in detail species of fungi obtained from human corpses in the future forensics experts may use the information during criminal investigations to determine when someone died fungi parasitic plants that lack chlorophyll leaves and true roots and stems often form part of the natural decomposition process that recycles nutrients back into the food chain the fungi feed on the dead says lead author kiyoshi ishii whose teams findings are published in the may issue of the journal legal medicine ishii a biologist at dokkyo university school of medicine in japan and his colleagues analysed two humans whose bodies were found decomposing in very different environments the first was a corpse discovered lying face down on a concrete floor in an abandoned house police determined the body belonged to a yearold man who had been missing for months the scientists observed yellow and white fungi on the deceaseds chest abdomen and thighs but little insect infestation probably because the house was dry and isolated the second case study involved skeletal remains clad in a shirt and pants found in a forest forensics specialists determined the body belonged to a to yearold man who had died at least months before the bodys discovery the scientists once again detected yellow and white fungi growing on the corpse back in the lab ishii and his team collected the fungi and incubated them in a laboratory they identified several species including gliocladium a slimy counterpart to penicillin eurotium chevalieri a fungus that can be bright yellow and e repens which is commonly found in soil the eurotium species dominated the collected samples ishii explains that the white and yellow colours are associated with the sexual stages for eurotium fungi the parasite produces threadlike filaments that terminate with circular colourful structures called ascomata that are involved in reproduction the fungi also produce colourful conidia or asexual spores which tend to form in the morning and germinate in the afternoon and evening ishii says the environment in which a body lies rather than the biochemistry of the individual or the manner of death tends to dictate how much or how little fungi will colonise a cadaver flies beetles fungi yuichi chigusa a medical parasitologist and entomologist at dokkyo medical universitys school of medicine says that fly larvae usually infest corpses within an hour to a halfday after the victims death they are then followed by coleoptera beetles and fungi he is excited about the potential of fungi for further aiding detective work i am surprised that fungus is a potential tool for determining post mortem intervals in cadavers without infestation of dipteran larvae andor beetles chigusa says therefore i think it is very important that forensic pathologists forensic entomologists and forensic mycologists cooperate in determining post mortem intervals during forensic analysis these flatheaded dinosaurs went headtohead million years ago a dragonlike dinosaur named after harry potters alma mater has performed a bit of black magic on its own family tree say us palaeontologists who unveiled the dragon king of hogwarts the newly described hornyheaded dinosaur dracorex hogwartsia lived about million years ago in south dakota just a million years short of the extinction of all dinosaurs but its flat almost storybookstyle dragon head has overturned everything palaeontologists thought they knew about the domehead dinos called pachycephalosaurs what you knew about pachycephalosaurs you can chuck it says dr spencer lucas curator of palaeontology at the new mexico museum of natural history and science in albuquerque dracorex hogwartsia is a rather fantastic new dinosaur affirms palaeontologist dr robert sullivan of the state museum of pennsylvania for years dinosaur experts had thought the classic domeheaded headbutting sorts of pachycephalosaurs evolved from earlier flatheaded ancestors the last thing they expected to find at the end of the age of dinosaurs was a dramatically flatheaded pachycerphalosaurs or pachy if you were going to predict the kind of dinosaur that would live at that time it would not be this says lucas without so much as a nod of the head or the waving of a wand hogwartsia has reversed the pachy family tree instead of going from flatheaded to domed youre going from domeheaded to flat says sullivan along with several colleagues sullivan coauthored the first detailed study of the new dinosaur published recently in the new mexico museum of natural history and science bulletin dracorex hogwartsia which translates to dragon king of hogwarts was unearthed in in the hell creek formation of south dakota by three amateur fossil hunters working with the childrens museum of indianapolis but it wasnt until it was at the museum while the fossil was being carefully prepared that renowned dinosaur researcher dr robert bakker happened to catch sight of it while visiting bakker then recruited pachycerphalosaurs expert sullivan and other palaeontologists to take a closer look how to name a dinosaur but how did it get its name a group of children at the childrens museum of indianapolis drew the connection to the fanciful school of witchcraft that the famous fictional wizard harry potter attends and came up with the name hogwartsia its a very dragonlike looking dinosaur says sullivan jk rowling author of the harry potter series has been notified and apparently rather likes the new name i am absolutely thrilled to think that hogwarts has made a small claw mark upon the fascinating world of dinosaurs says rowling in a statement i happen to know more on the subject of palaeontology than many might credit because my eldest daughter was utahraptorobsessed and i am now living with a passionate tyrannosaurus rexlover aged three my credibility has soared within my scienceloving family and i am very much looking forward to reading dr bakker and his colleagues paper describing my dinosaur exercise seems to put a brake on runaway cell growth one of the hallmarks of cancer the anticancer effects of exercise are due to increases in a protein that blocks cell growth and induces cell death say australian researchers this would slow down runaway cell growth one of the hallmarks of cancer the researchers suggest but the team led by dr andrew haydon from monash medical school in melbourne cannot say how much exercise someone needs to show these effects the researchers publish their results in the may issue of the journal gut they identified new cases of colorectal cancer in a prospective study of adults recruited between and they then looked at baseline body mass index level of physical activity reported and compared baseline levels of two proteins insulinlike growth factor binding protein or igfbp and insulinlike growth factor or igf analyses centered on colon cancer patients followed for more than years among subjects who were physically active an increase in igfbp was associated with a reduction in colon cancerspecific deaths there seemed to be no association with igf for the physically inactive there was no association between igf or igfbp and colon cancer survival the researchers conclude that increased levels of igfbp with exercise blocks igfs proliferative effect on cell growth igf has been shown to stimulate cell growth inhibit cell death and promote angiogenesis the formation of new blood vessels which tumors need to grow we did not look at the amount of physical activity needed to reduce colorectal cancer incidence haydon points out other studies have shown a doseeffect meaning the more exercise the lower the risk however our study did not try to address this issue we were examining the effect of physical activity on ones prognosis following a diagnosis of bowel cancer and the possible mechanisms behind this effect for more information about cancer including fact sheets and where to go for counselling see the cancer council australia website elephants snakes and octopus tentacles have inspired a new type of flexible robot a robot with a flexible trunklike arm could one day work like an elephant to grasp unwieldy loads say its developers it could also navigate like a snake through the rubble of a disaster zone or feel around inside the dark crevasses of other planets conventional robots have rigid joints picture a cranelike appendage with a clawshaped hand but the octarms nimble design allows it to move freely and adapt to its surroundings these robots are invertebrate robots and are good at getting into tight spaces and wriggling around says ian walker a professor of electrical and computer engineering his team at clemson university in south carolina has been working on the project for nearly years conventional robots work best when given a predictable job in a structured setting such as a factory assembly line but in the unpredictable unstructured environment of a disaster zone or the surface of a distant planet a more flexible robot is needed walker and a team of researchers from eight institutions in the us and israel built a strong dexterous robotic arm that uses tubes pumped with compressed air to mimic the muscles that control tongues trunks and tentacles a scientist uses a joystick to the control the octarm which resembles an elephant trunk thick at the base and tapered toward the tip a computer responds to the joysticks motions by changing the air pressure inside individual tubes for example to move the octarm from the extended position into a coiled shape air pressure must be increased in the tubes on the side of the arm facing up simultaneously air pressure decreases in the tubes on the downwardfacing side of the arm the force of increased air pressure on one side of the arm pulls it into the coiled position to extend it again the scientists apply air pressure the other way around curling and lifting more complicated motions such as curling around an object and lifting require more sophisticated computer algorithms developing these algorithms is one of the bigger challenges facing walker and his team in field tests the octarm successfully grasped balls and pieces of wood even clinging to them while submerged in rushing water the octarms are not precise or positional but they are compliant and flexible and can conform to crazy shapes and do some things that traditional robots cant says shane farritor associate professor of mechanical engineering at the university of nebraskalincoln later this year walker and his team will be working to improve the octarms precision adding sensors and a camera chances are youll feel good about lifedefining events when you look back on them when we remember events that helped to shape our identity such as a breakup or marriage we tend to downplay the fear anger or other negative emotions and remember more of the positive ones a new study indicates these findings suggest that healthy individuals work to build a positive narrative identity that will yield an overall optimistic tone to the most important recalled events from their lives write study authors drs michael conway and wendyjo wood of concordia university in montreal quebec the findings published in the latest issue of the journal of personality may also have implications for someones mental health mental health is maintained or improved by peoples attempts to make sense of their life experiences conway says people try to see the positive in even very difficult life experiences and come to downplay as much as they can how negative some events were in the past he explains for their research conway and wood investigated peoples emotional memories for selfdefining events which they described as emotionally complex events that contribute to a persons sense of identity or overall life story in one study university students were asked to think about an important past event that helped define themselves they were then asked to describe the event in various terms including the extent to which it had a big impact on them and how much it helped them learn about themselves and about life based on the students responses conway and wood conclude that a persons perception of the impact of an event is a good marker for meaning making that is the process that results in an individual integrating an event with his or her positive sense of identity in a second study university students were asked to report and describe on paper five selfdefining memories and to rate those events on a fivepoint scale in terms of its impact they also completed two questionnaires about the emotions they felt when the event occurred and how they currently felt about the event respectively happiness and pride conway and wood found that when the study participants reflected on negative events such as conflict with bosses or teachers death or physical or sexual assault they reported that they currently felt less negative emotions like anger and disgust and more happiness and pride than they had felt at the time of the event and when the students reflected on positive events like a dating relationship or marriage recreation or attaining a personal goal they reported feeling just as happy as they had felt at the time of the event as well as similarly intense feelings of love and pride again however they also reported feeling less anger embarrassment guilt and other negative emotions than they had initially felt what was striking is that the findings held up for a wide range of emotions conway says adding that when making sense of their past experiences people would downplay all the negative types of feelings they had such as fear and anger death in the family how does this relate to a negative event like the death of a grandmother for example the sad event is still mostly sad conway says but the positive emotions have come out more people are seeing the silver lining so to speak and may feel happy afterwards as they realise that the grandmothers suffering is over he says conway says how the practice is common among men and women in a variety of life situations everyone can experience strong emotional reactions in extreme situations and everyone needs to come to terms with such events in order to maintain a positive sense of self and a positive sense of the world at large bacteria found in household sewage can generate their own electricity now scientists say they are one step closer to harnessing it the waste water we flush down the loo could one day be used to generate electricity scientists from belgium say the ghent university researchers have designed a way to boost the output of microbial fuel cells an emerging technology that captures the energy produced when bacteria break down waste and turn it into electrical current investigators from around the world are researching the potential of microbial fuel cells but prototypes so far have only produced tiny amounts of electricity at the moment we are still at the stage of basic research but the potential for the technology is good says associate professor zhiguo yuan from the advanced wastewater management centre at australias university of queensland the latest paper which appears in the journal environmental science and technology brings the concept closer to reality the researchers show that six small fuel cells stacked together can generate higher voltages and increased current the efficiency of these systems is determined by the distances the electrons have to travel says coauthor dr korneel rabaey if you want to generate a lot of power from microbial fuel cells you have to have a very thin reactor but you also need to be able to work with a high volume of waste water putting several small cells together ticks both of those boxes says rabaey who moved to the university of queensland a month ago this work shows one step we need to make larger scale designs but scientists arent sure exactly which bugs generate the electricity in the fuel cells there is a mixture of those that can live in that environment says yuan treating water scientists are most interested in using microbegenerated electricity to power the water treatment process itself as well as producing current the technology can also help clear bacteria out of the water it might also clean out substances like sulfur and nitrogen once scientists figure out how to build largescale fuel cells rabaey says the cells will probably be used first to treat industrial waste water the idea of using stuff we flush down the toilet to power our light bulbs is probably a more distant hope but he says it is not out of the question the amount of energy that is in waste is incredible he says just one sugarcube for example has enough energy to power a laptop for hours and the stuff in our waste water is just different forms of sugar locusts reach a critical point when they know when to swarm like an army preparing for battle locusts instinctively wait until their battalion is large enough before falling into line and swarming ahead en masse researchers find the apparently leaderless group will fly around chaotically until the swarm reaches a certain density of numbers when they immediately assemble and become an orderly collective plague researchers led by dr jerome buhl from australias university of sydney have pinpointed this exact point of change called the tipping point by using statistical physics models of disordered and ordered particles the international team publishes its findings today in the journal science the researchers assembled a circular perspex arena shaped liked a mexican hat in the laboratory locusts were then released into the arena and their movements filmed as more and more locusts were added to the group the team found that at a low density of insects the locusts swarmed around chaotically at intermediate density the locusts banded together but changed their marching directions quickly but when enough insects were released into the arena to reach the critical tipping point insects per square metre the group immediately massed together and swarmed as one in a persistent direction coauthor professor steve simpson from the university of sydney says the statistical physics models of disordered and ordered particles used in the experiment are like dodgem cars racing around an arena you give these dodgem cars a set of simple local rules if somebody drives past them they must move and follow next to them if they see a dodgem car a little further away then they must move towards them if they get too close to another dodgem car they must bounce away from it he says if you scale that up to a whole bunch of dodgem cars or particles or locusts then as you start to add more and more to the arena or environment you suddenly get to a number where they all start moving in the same direction together buhl says the laboratory findings reflect similar findings in the field he says the research which was carried out with uk us and canadian researchers could be useful in controlling pest outbreaks that devastate crops and bring disease the new test is based on a stain that detects the protein keratin vaginal cells seen here dont express the protein giving a characteristic yellow colour but skin cells and some mouth cells do so they stain magenta and red a new forensic technique that tells scientists which cells come from which parts of the body could help solve sex crimes its developers say a new zealand phd student has found a simple way of identifying whether cell samples collected for dna testing come from the skin mouth or vagina all it really involves is a couple of stains and some microscope slides of the cell samples and you get some lovely different coloured cells says claire french from the university of auckland currently dna from cells found at a crime scene can link a person to the crime but cannot provide evidence about which part of the body the cells came from the technique french has developed involves staining epithelial cells the outer layer of body surfaces and organs which are easily shed or secreted the stain reveals different colours corresponding to the presence of the protein keratin skin cells express keratin and stain magenta vaginal cells dont express keratin and stain orange and cells in the mouth vary depending on their location and stain red sue vintiner a forensic scientist with new zealands environmental science and research esr says the technology could have practical applications ive been involved in cases where weve been unable to scientifically prove that an object has been used to violate someone in a sexual assault or whether it was just touched by the alleged victim she says claires work could change that its developers say the technology could be used to develop a portable histological staining kit for routine use at crime scenes and in forensic laboratories the research which will soon be presented at the european academy of forensic sciences conference has received strong support from the new zealand police claires findings have also earned her new zealands mcdiarmid young scientist of the year award the intellectual property underpinning the research has been jointly protected by esr and the university of auckland poison ivy a species introduced to australia and now a weed will grow faster and become more poisonous with increased co levels add another item to the list of health threats posed by global warming poison ivy thats more poisonous and lots more of it when scientists increased co to the levels expected to be seen at the middle of this century poison ivy toxicodendron radicans grew more than twice as fast the plants also produced more of a type of urushiol the substance that causes an allergic reaction the researchers report online in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences this is bad news for those of us who suffer from poison ivy says lead author dr jacqueline mohan of the marine biological laboratory in woods hole massachusetts mohan and her team studied plots of a forested area surrounded by pvc pipes that pumped out co allowing them evaluate the effects of the greenhouse gas in a reallife forest environment they compared poison ivy growth over a sixyear period in three coenriched areas and three areas with normal air under the highco conditions the poison ivy plants grew faster every year than the control plants the plants also contained more of the urushiol compound that causes an allergic reaction more than of the worlds population will develop an itchy rash if exposed to poison ivy over the past two decades mohan notes scientists have observed increased worldwide growth in vines which is in some cases choking out the regrowth of trees vines benefit from extra co she explains as the gas fuels photosynthesis unlike trees vines have to devote relatively little energy to growing wood and can instead pump the extra photosynthesis energy into leaf production a seed bank to be built in the artic will be essential to protect future agriculture its proponents say a frozen noahs ark to safeguard the worlds crop seeds from disasters will be built on a remote arctic island off norway the norwegian government says construction of the global seed vault in a mountainside on the island of svalbard kilometres from the north pole would start in june with completion due in september norway will by this contribute to the global system for ensuring the diversity of food plants a noahs ark on svalbard if you will says norwegian agriculture and food minister terje riisjohansen the doomsday vault would be built near longyaerbyen svalbards main village with space for three million seed varieties it would store seeds including rice wheat and barley as well as fruits and vegetables it would be a remote arctic backup for scores of other seed banks around the world which may be more vulnerable to risks ranging from nuclear war to mundane power failures gene banks can be affected by shutdowns natural disasters wars or simply a lack of money riisjohansen says loss of genetic diversity would mean losing a part of cultural heritage we also reduce the ability of agriculture to meet new challenges relating to climate change population increase and so on he says the seeds would be stored at degc if the power fails the seeds will probably stay frozen the temperature there is around degc degc in the summer but we believe that even if the freezers broke down a suitable temperature would last for months says grethe helene evjen a senior adviser at the agriculture ministry this will be primarily a duplicate storage for plant seeds already stored elsewhere she says seeds would remain the property of nations making deposits norway would provide million norwegian crowns u million to build the vault norway has long talked of building the arctic seed vault without previously taking action for about years some varieties of seed have been stored in a disused svalbard mine under a plan to see if they can germinate after years norway has worked with the un food and agriculture organization on the plans it would also get financial support from the global crop diversity trust to help poor countries use the storage is technology a match for evolution and does this mean that modern humans are still evolving new evidence that the hobbit made the stone tools found alongside it might be evidence that humans are still evolving says an australian researcher the use of technology doesnt mean we have outwitted evolutionary selection pressures says dr mark moore an expert on ancient stone flaking technology at the university of new england he made the comments in light of research published in todays issue of the journal nature on how early hominids used tools on the indonesian island of flores some scientists have recently argued that the tools found alongside the hobbit at the liang bua cave are too complex to have been made by anyone but modern humans but moore along with australian and indonesian colleagues think otherwise the team analysed the techniques used to make over tools found at mata menge a site about kilometres from where the hobbit was found the researchers say although the tools would have been made years before the hobbit was around they seemed just as complex as the ones found alongside it the researchers say the tools were probably made by ancestors of homo floresiensis suggesting a long history of toolmaking on the island this supports the idea that the hobbit even with its small brain was capable of making the tools found alongside it says moore he previously reported that such tools could be made without the degree of forethought usually associated with modern humans the techniques used to make the tools arent quite as sophisticated as a lot of archaeologists would have you believe says moore they are certainly within the capabilities of a smallbrained hominid implications for evolution those who discovered the hobbit believe it evolved from a larger bodied larger brained ancestor that shrank over time as it was isolated on the island the fact that the hominid could still make stone tools despite its shrinking brain suggests toolmaking was key to survival on the island this supports the argument that technology helps humans survive changing environments but moore thinks it also tells us that technology doesnt protect us from evolutionary selection pressures like predators or other environmental factors that affect our survival the environment is a bigger force than we give it credit for he says theres an underlying assumption in the popular media in particular and amongst some scientists that since we adapt to our environment through technology that somehow this is buffering us from the forces of natural selection says moore but he says the use of technology by the hobbits ancestors to adapt to their environment did not stop them from shrinking in response to selection pressures even thought they had a technological adaptation to the environment it didnt mean that they had stopped evolving says moore they clearly had continued evolving technology was not able to stop that from happening he says this could be relevant to current debates over whether modern humans are evolving we are so surrounded by technology every day says moore but that doesnt necessarily mean that the environment isnt also having an effect saturns moon enceladus might have rolled or rotated itself to place an area of low density at the south pole this illustrates the moons interior with warm lowdensity material rising to the surface yellow from within or from its rocky core red millions of years ago saturns moon enceladus may have somersaulted in space creating an icespewing hot spot on the moons south pole scientists suggest for now it is the only explanation why the small satellite sports a very active though isolated polar region dr francis nimmo an assistant professor at the university of california at santa cruz and team publish their research today in the journal nature during flybys of enceladus the saturnorbiting cassini probe has snapped pictures of gigantic icy plumes indicating active geysers at the moons south pole researchers who have been studying images and other data collected by the cassini spacecraft believe a relatively warm blob of ice rose from beneath the moons frozen surface it could also have emerged from within its frigid and rocky core less dense than the surrounding terrain the blob would be more susceptible to saturns powerful gravitational tug on enceladus a grip that at one time seems to have caused the moon to roll over says nimmo the team calculated the effects of a lowdensity blob beneath the surface of enceladus and showed it could cause the moon to roll over by up to deg and put the blob at the pole it may not have been a solitary incident either nimmo says it could be like a lava lamp and each time a blob is reproduced it causes the moon to flip he says the manoeuver may not be all that uncommon studies of magnetically charged particles around earth show evidence that the planets north pole may at one time have resided elsewhere nimmo adds likewise uranuss moon miranda shows evidence of multiple flips he says the researchers plan followup studies to look for more evidence first they want to carefully examine surface images for craters the moon should be more heavily cratered in the areas that face its direction of travel if enceladus flipped its current face should show fewer impacts than its trailing regions which at one time may have been facing forward the pull of gravity the team also would like to fly cassini low over enceladus southern pole to see if its gravitational pull is slightly weaker than at other parts of the moon cassini would become the test object while radio antennas on earth track its movement during the flyby a minute change in cassinis speed perhaps as small as a centimetre per second would be an indication of a lowermass region at the pole its a difficult measurement to make but wed like to try nimmo says scientists are not sure what mechanism fuels enceladus hot spot but they believe it is tied to tidal forces from saturn and possibly a sister moon janus you have this tiny moon blasting out a huge amount of heat nimmo says presumably it has to get squeezed something is causing all this pushing and pulling its astounding that cassini found a region of current geological activity on an icy moon that we would expect to be frigidly cold especially down at this moons equivalent of antarctica adds coauthor dr robert pappalardo a planetary scientist and assistant professor at nasas jet propulsion laboratory it took just million years for the artic ocean to go from bathtemperature to frigid dramatic shifts in earths climate system drove the sea at the north pole from subtropical temperatures to icy chill in the relatively brief span of million years according to a series of studies the papers report a mission in which european scientists aboard a ship braved flowing walls of ice to delve deep into the lomonosov ridge on the floor of the arctic ocean the precious cores of sediment retrieved from up to metres below the seabed give an idea of the planets climate going back million years thanks to the fossilised creatures plants and stones buried in them this surveyed period kicks off with an astonishingly warm period called the palaeoceneeocene thermal maximum at one point during this era the arctic ocean was degc then around million years ago large volumes of cool freshwater for some reason were dumped into the arctic chilling the sea to around degc and diluting its saltiness so much that in summer months a species of green freshwater fern covered much of its surface at million years ago the first ice started to form as evidenced by pebbles dropped by icebergs and the relative cooling has continued to the modern era the studies published today the journal nature were carried out in an initiative called arctic coring expedition a swedishflagged norwegianoperated drillship the vidar viking manoeuvred in water metres deep just kilometres from the north pole protected by a russian and a swedish icebreaker at times the drill site was covered with ice metres thick says one of the lead authors jan blackman a professor at stockholm university we encountered an icefloe of multiyear ice harder and denser than ice from just one arctic winter it was like driving into a brick wall natural shifts in climate in a history spanning some billion years earth has gone through natural shifts in climate change the drivers for this include changes in solar radiation surges in volcanic activity releases of methane stored underground shifts in vegetation and the light that is reflected back into space by polar icecaps the study delves into the distant past and does not cover recent history especially the industrial revolution whose fossilfuel emissions many blame for global warming evidence has accumulated in recent years that arctic ice cover is thinning and shrinking in response to this warming which in turn may have a big impact on polar bears and other species the icecap at the north pole floats on the arctic ocean which means its melting does not affect global sea levels in antarctica it lies mainly on rock which means that even a partial melting would threaten coastal cities and deltas around the world bushfire smoke hangs over sydney climate change could lead to a increase in the area burned by bushfire in sydney by the middle of this century australian research shows this does not necessarily mean new land will be affected the increase may instead be due to some areas being burnt more frequently fire ecologist professor ross bradstock of the university of wollongong will report his findings at the australasian bushfire conference in brisbane next week sydneys changing fire regime is important to understand because its australias most populated city says bradstock which itself increases a citys risk of bushfires sydney is also ringed by fireprone vegetation and has a firefriendly climate and layout for instance a lot of the city is in the path of firebearing winds its the biggest fire game in the country says bradstock in the past years around a million hectares of sydneys have been burned by bushfire including areas in the greater blue mountains world heritage area and research published earlier this year suggests sydneys fire risk is getting worse says bradstock researchers at csiro and the bureau of meteorology analysed climate change models and predicted by there would be a increase in the number of days with a high very high or extreme fire danger that means an increase in the chance of having conditions which are conducive to major fires says bradstock major fires those that burn hectares or more are only a minor proportion of the total number of fires but account for of the area burned he says shift in fire weather bradstock wanted to find out how this shift in fire weather would translate in terms of the actual increase in number of fires and the area burnt to do this he developed a model that combined the csiro and meteorology bureau predictions with historical records of fires from the blue mountains area to the west and the central coast area to the north of sydney the models show the relationship between worsening fire weather and number of major fires is not linear bradstock says the models show that while a increase in highrisk days would result in a increase in the area burned a increase in highrisk days would result in a increase in area burned over the years between and he says this would equate to up to more hectares than was burned over the past years bradstock says the central coast area is most vulnerable because it has a hotter and drier environment and a greater density of people living close to bushland this is the first time such an approach has been used in australia and can be transferred to other locations says bradstock he developed the model in his previous job at the new south wales department of environment and conservation where people live will have a big impact on how technology will affect their lives says a new report that highlights the technological divide australia is among countries that will gain the most from technology by a study finds but poorer countries look to miss out the rand corporation study finds that it is countries that are already on technologys cutting edge not those that are currently lagging in technological advances which will benefit the most where people live will have a big impact on how technology applications affect their personal health and standard of living and will also play a part in determining the ability of their countries to protect them and their environment says dr richard silberglitt one of the lead authors the study looked at countries that were ranked as technologically advanced proficient developing or lagging people in the us and canada germany representing western europe south korea and japan australia and israel will benefit the most from advances in technology and they will be able to exploit technology regardless of its sophistication the report concludes as examples of potential hightech advances it cites growing tissue to implant and replace human body parts creating pervasive sensor networks in public areas to conduct realtime surveillance providing access to information any time and anywhere and creating wearable computers china india russia and others such as poland representing eastern europe could also make significant advances along with simpler ones the report says of what it describes as scientifically proficient countries these countries could for example provide their people with drug therapies that preferentially attack specific tumors or pathogens and vastly improved medical diagnostic and surgical procedures scientifically developing countries mexico turkey brazil colombia indonesia south africa and chile are poised to take advantage of modestly sophisticated technology applications including devices to constantly track the movement of everything from products to people easytouse health diagnostic tests that give immediate results for a large range of infections and environmentally friendly manufacturing methods the study says the scientifically lagging countries fiji the dominican republic georgia nepal pakistan egypt iran jordan kenya cameroon and chad are burdened by problemplagued political systems a lack or resources or infrastructure and class disparities the study says when such countries have the will to make changes they can improve the lives of their citizens the study adds citing examples such as cheap solar energy for remote or portable applications ways to purify water that wont require major infrastructure and rural wireless communications china and india lead the group of scientifically proficient the study adds yet they need to continue making progress in financial institutions legal and policy issues rural infrastructure environmental protection research and development investments rural education and literacy and governance and stability if they are to advance it says the itokawa asteroid is made up of loosely packed bits of sand and boulders a japanese spacecraft that landed on an asteroid found a ball of rubble held loosely together by its own gravity unlike other asteroids that have been visited reports say the spacecraft hayabusa whose name means falcon in japanese hovered over the nearearth asteroid itokawa last year taking several measurements before landing briefly on the orbiting gravel pile itokawa has two parts resembling the head and body of a sea otter according to professor akira fujiwara of the japan aerospace exploration agency and his colleagues in todays issue of the journal science previously studied asteroids appear to be lumps of solid rock but itokawa is made up of loosely packed bits of sand and boulders they say their findings could have implications for deflecting asteroids that might pass too closely to the earth in the future weve never had a closeup look at such a small asteroid until now says dr takahiro hiroi of brown university in rhode island who worked on the joint usjapanese study large asteroids such as eros are completely covered with a thick regolith a blanket of looser material created by space weathering with itokawa we believe we have witnessed a developing stage of the formation of this regolith itokawa is very small just metres long but it is close orbiting just million kilometres away from earth although it does not threaten to collide with earth it makes a tempting scientific target near miss hayabusa very nearly did not make it the little spacecraft now bringing a capsule of samples back to earth uses an electronic ion propulsion system whose efficiency should be critical to future missions in deep space at one point hayabusa lost communication with its controllers writes associate professor erik asphaug of the university of california santa cruz in a commentary in science its hydrazine fuel had leaked away shortly after the second sample collection attempt two of the reaction wheels had failed and the battery was dead adding insult to injury minerva intended to be the first asteroid surface robot had been released during an unexpected manoeuver and was lost to space he adds yet despite these heartbreaking setbacks hayabusa has been a stunning success both for asteroid science and for deep space concept testing asphaug says information delivered by the spacecraft enhances our understanding of nearearth objects nearearth objects are not only important scientifically our planet formed from them but have also become political hot potatoes given the growing pressure to do something to mitigate the risks they may pose to earth the spacecraft launched in is expected to glide back to earth in and crashland in the australian desert the search for evidence of a killer meteorite continues remains of what is believed to be a giant antarctic crater could be evidence of a meteorite that caused earths biggest mass extinction and triggered the break up of gondwana scientists say while some experts are excited by the find not all are convinced this is a crater all let alone one that came from a kilometre wide meteorite that wiped out most of life on earth geophysicist dr ralph von frese of ohio state university in the us and colleagues are due to report their research at an antarctic science meeting in hobart early next month a number of suspected impact craters have been linked to the socalled great dying at the end of the permian million years ago this was a time when of marine life and of life on land were wiped out but says von frese his is the best candidate for the killer crater first he says the circular land features analysed in the wilkes land region of east antarctica south of australia suggest a big enough impact to have caused catastrophic damage to earth at kilometres wide the crater would be more than twice the size of the chicxulub crater formed from the impact believed to have wiped out the dinosaurs much later say the researchers second says von frese evidence including its location suggests it is older than million years the date at which australia drifted northwards from gondwana third the landform has a special telltale feature of impact craters at its centre a kilometre wide plug of dense material says von frese this is expected to be mantle material that was sucked up as the meteorite rebounded from the earths surface this socalled mascon is a well known feature of craters on the moon says von frese who studies lunar impact craters and he says no other suspected craters linked to the permian extinction show this feature gravity measurements von frese and team mapped the crater using two different sets of measurements gravity measurements taken by nasas grace satellites show a higher readings in the centre of the crater this corresponds to the slightly raised area of the mascon detected by another imaging method says von frese but what was interesting was that the coastline where australia would have fitted together with antarctica took a bite out of the concentric rings or shock waves around the crater von frese says this suggests that the ocean between antarctica and australia opened after the crater was formed he thinks the meteorite that caused the crater could have hit million years ago triggering a process that culminated in the break up of gondwana or so million years later mixed reception von freses report has been met with a mixed response from the australian scientific community im quite excited about the possibility that this is another crater says dr peter morgan of the university of canberra morgan trained in gravity analysis at ohio state university and says he has groundbased gravity and radar measurements of the same area he says he will now make it a priority to process the data and share it with the other researchers to see if it supports the theory earth scientist professor john talent of sydneys macquarie university says before the land structure can be linked to the permian extinction a precise age for it is needed von freses team did not directly date the crater its almost kilometres beneath the ice talent also says that research in the past couple of years suggests the permian extinction was a result of a number of events extending over several million years rather than an instantaneous impact vulcanologist peter whitehead of james cook university in cairns says volcanic activity played a central role in the permian extinction he says one suggestion has been that meteorite impacts send shock waves through the earth and cause volcanic activity on the other side of the planet the discovery of year old figs shows people became farmers much earlier than we once thought driedup figs found in israel may have been the first cultivated crop more than years ago researchers say the discovery published in the journal science pushes back the earliest estimates of when agriculture began by years and it suggests that centuries before people figured out how to plant barley and other crops they knew how to propagate fruit trees for sweet treats say researchers professor ofer baryosef of harvard university and israeli coauthors some years ago there was a critical switch in the human mind from exploiting the earth as it is to actively changing the environment to suit our needs says baryosef a professor of anthropology people decided to intervene in nature and supply their own food rather than relying on what was provided by the gods this shift to a sedentary lifestyle grounded in the growing of wild crops such as barley and wheat marked a dramatic change from million years of human history as mobile huntergatherers people were known to have cultivated figs for thousands of years but this finding surprised even experts it is generally accepted that the fig tree was domesticated in the near east some years ago says baryosefs team here we report the discovery of nine carbonised fig fruits stored in gilgal i an early neolithic village located in the lower jordan valley which dates to to years ago a special type of fig the figs are a variety that produces a large sweet fruit as opposed to the wild type the researchers say in this variety known as parthenocarpic figs the fruit develops without insect pollination and is prevented from falling off the tree which allows it to become soft sweet and edible but because such figs do not produce seeds they cannot reproduce unless people propagate them perhaps by planting shoots or branches dried figs similar in size and structure imported from iran are found today in the markets of london the scientists say dried figs the carbonised figs were not distorted which the researchers say suggests they may have been dried for human consumption once the parthenocarpic mutation occurred humans must have recognised that the resulting fruits do not produce new trees and fig tree cultivation became a common practice baryosef says in this intentional act of planting a specific variant of fig tree we can see the beginnings of agriculture this edible fig would not have survived if not for human intervention at the same site researchers found foods that must have been gathered such as acorns and wild oats the milky way has asymmetrical spiral arms some longer than others our galaxy is a much wilder looking tentacled beast than suspected say astronomers who have used a new technique to map the milky way radio astronomers used data from a painstaking galaxywide survey of hydrogen gas clouds throughout the milky way they found that instead of being a clean symmetrical spiral our home galaxy has extra long arms sprouting out on one side and is warped and armless on the other the odd layout could be the result of colossal cannibalistic galactic collisions or intergalactic tides say the researchers online on the journal science astronomer professor leo blitz of the university of california at berkeley says the most surprising thing about the spiral arms on our half of the milky way is that we could see spiral structure all the way to the edge of the galactic disc the long elegant spiral arms are visible despite a galaxy full of dust because hydrogen gas emits radio waves that penetrate the dust the distances to the various arms could be worked out by the doppler shift in their radio waves this is similar in principle to how the tone of a trains horn sounds higherpitched when its approaching than when its receding far side of the milky way in contrast to the near side of the milky way the far side appears less orderly instead of having clearly defined curved arms theres a messy bulging area explains coauthor evan levine its bent like a vinyl record in the sun levine says that would show up in a map like this as for what causes the weird warping it could be the result of galactic collisions this lack of symmetry often occurs as galaxies eat little galaxies blitz says another possibility is that the bulge is caused by the gravitational tug of the milky ways small satellite galaxies visible from the southern hemisphere the most obvious of these satellite galaxies are the magellanic clouds which are visible to the naked eye from earths southern hemisphere the magellanic clouds are very prominent like the tides of the earth says astrophysicist professor frank shu of the university of california at san diego earths oceans bulge with tides because of the external gravitational tug of the moon likewise the magellanic clouds may cause the bulge in the far side of the milky way he explains more details about the milky ways structure are likely to be forthcoming says levine blind spots their new map has a few blind spots caused by the motion of our own solar system inside the milky way these blind spots show up on their map as an empty circle at the centre of the galaxy and as two blank wedges on opposite sides of our solar system its possible that more advanced analyses of the data will glean meaningful information from the hydrogen emissions of those areas as well says levine for his part blitz is pleased to be able to see so much of the galaxy after many years of trying he recalls that in he published another paper in science describing only a part of a single spiral arm its like trying to figure out the shape of a forest when youre sitting in the middle of it says blitz the number is associated with satan and may people believe it is a bad omen today is the sixth day of the sixth month of the year boil it down and youve got the number of the beast according to the bibles book of revelation which prophecies the end of the world but if the date is enough to send you scurrying under your bedcovers you may be a victim of what an australian expert describes as a cognitive virus professor john bigelow an expert in superstition and pseudoscience from melbournes monash university says the number traditionally has a dark significance for occultists alchemists heretics and people of a superstitious bent theyre a bit like a cognitive virus he says of superstitions like computer viruses they get into peoples brains they cause people to pass them onto someone else and the person who hears them finds it difficult to get them out of their mind but i think its better not to suppress them superstitions are like the flu they need to be managed the mythology of goes back to chapter in revelation the apocalyptic final book of the new testament which states let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast his number is six hundred threescore and six bigelow says much of the imagery in revelation has a schizophrenic quality and is often invoked by people with schizophrenia but he says its impossible to say whether the author john of patmos or st john the apostle suffered from schizophrenia or delusional thinking macquarie universitys professor max coltheart an australian cognitive neuropsychologist says being superstitious about doesnt necessarily add up to a delusion if you believe something that people around you dont believe in and theres no evidence for it thats a good working definition of delusion he says if its in the bible someone might call that evidence associate professor of anthropology phillips stevens of the university at buffalo in new york says fears of are actually based on a misinterpretation of the bible he says the beast referred to in chapter isnt satan but several entities biblical scholars have pointed out there are several beasts in chapter and elsewhere and they all refer variously to rome roman emperors and roman cults of god and emperor worship he says john of patmos was writing to other persecuted christians in code perfect numbers six also has significance because it is the first perfect number says bigelow perfect numbers which are rare are the sum of their factors for example and it can be divided by one two and three the next perfect numbers are and the combination also occurred in the year of the great fire of london however this also marked the year in which sir isaac newton published his law of gravity leading it to be dubbed the annus mirabilis conjuring up thoughts of doom satan and rampaging evil in relation to a number is an example of magical thinking stevens says where things associated with good things bring food fortune and things associated with disastrous events bring negative consequences but bigelow says magical thought can have benefits that science doesnt science is not tapping into our emotional nature whereas superstitions are a reflection of something about us he says it may be a mistake to think you can control the world by projecting your own associations onto it to turn it into science but its not a mistake to register that we do have these deep correspondences among our ideas keeping cut fruit chilled is the key to keeping vitamin c levels high food scientists show health conscious but time poor grab a pack of packaged readytoeat fruit and your body will be none the wiser thats the message from new international research showing that chilled readytoeat freshcut fruit retains high levels of vitamin c and other antioxidants cutting and packaging fruit has almost no effect on the main antioxidants scientists report in the journal of agricultural and food chemistry in fact levels of some antioxidants increased in selected fruits researchers including those from the university of california davis took pineapples watermelon rockmelon strawberries mangoes and kiwifruits and processed half as freshcut and left half whole both lots of fruit were refrigerated under identical conditions for nine days before being tested for nutrient content tests revealed only small losses of antioxidant compounds in the cut fruit compared to fruit left whole for example losses in vitamin c after six days at degc were less than in mango strawberry and watermelon pieces in pineapple pieces in kiwifruit and in rockmelon cubes no losses in carotenoids free radical scavengers that are thought to enhance the immune system were found in kiwifruit slices and watermelon losses in other fruits ranged from in rockmelon mango and strawberry to in pineapple interestingly total carotenoid content increased in mango and watermelon cubes in response to light exposure the findings dont surprise australian food technologist keith richardson who says cold is generally the key to keeping nutritional content the fruits and vegetables are chilled prior to cutting and they dont gain a lot of temperature during the processing operation then theyre promptly returned to below before being sent out in refrigerated trucks to sit in refrigerated supermarket cabinets he says richardson a food technology liaison officer with food science australia says provided the cold chain is kept you wouldnt expect a significant loss of nutrients generally speaking the colder you keep fruit the slower its metabolism including any breakdown of nutrients meanwhile the research team says further studies are now needed to evaluate the effect of treatments on the nutrient retention of freshcut fruits this include treatments like modified atmosphere packaging and chemical dips for delaying softening and browning researchers say that rock formations in the pilbara represent a diverse fossil ecosystem but not everyone agrees researchers say they have found compelling new evidence of the earliest known forms of life on earth in ancient rock in australia australian and canadian scientists say they have found new varieties of stromatolites rock formations left billion years ago in the pilbara region of western australia if the researchers are right and the stromatolites represent the fossilised remains of early microbes this could cause scientists to revise estimates of when life began on earth some estimates are as recent as billion years ago the paper published today in the journal nature also fuels an ongoing controversy about whether the formations were made by living things or chemical processes lead author phd student abigail allwood from sydneys macquarie university says the scientists found a stromatolite reef formed by microbial organisms the reef along a kilometre part of the pilbara known as strelley pool chert stc contains new types of stromatolites some looking like upside down icecream cones others like egg cartons the astonishing thing is the reefs age which is a time in earths history when the very existence of life is uncertain she says were seeing evidence not just of lifes existence but that it was probably well established and already biodiverse which suggests it could have emerged much earlier in earths history but detractors say theyre not convinced martin brasier professor of palaeobiology at the university of oxford has long argued against the biogenesis theory of the stc stromatolites and he isnt convinced by todays paper much caution is needed when making claims about the earliest signs of life he says in rocks of this great age we must assume the hypothesis of a nonbiological origin seven new types the stc stromatolites were first discovered more than years ago when they were declared to most likely be of biological origin subsequent papers argued various alternative theories including that they were formed by hydrothermal deposits that produced a mineral crust with structures mimicking stromatolites today allwood reports she has found seven different types of stromatolite potentially reflecting at least seven different types of organism stromatolites in the modern environment are associated with a whole community of organisms so potentially were talking about much more diversity than just seven types of organisms she says but brasier argues that allwood and her team have demonstrated the exact opposite of biogenesis he says if the structures had been made by living things they would have produced uniform rather than varied shapes the wide range of stromatolites reported in nature indicates they are actually selforganising structures of largely physicochemical origin he says like sand dunes or crystal formations similar structures have been produced in the laboratory without microbes he says a window on the evolution of life allwood says her research sheds new light not only on when but how life began she says the first stromatolites appeared as soon as the carbonate platform containing formations became submerged by rising sea levels its like the organisms were literally waiting in the wings for the right conditions to emerge and they just pounced and spread rapidly everywhere she says she says her results also contradict theories that early life emerged and flourished in extreme conditions what weve found is that the hydrothermal activity occurs immediately stratigraphically below and above the stc she says the rise of the stromatolites occurs as the hydrothermal activity goes away and the fall of the stromatolites occurs when the hydrothermal activity comes back this certainly supports the notion of life getting a firm foothold and flourishing in association with something quite normal she says apart from the determination of the antiquity of life on earth being an end in itself her research will help the search for signs of life on other planets including mars these sorts of studies are crucial for informing techniques and approaches for detecting biosignatures on mars and how well distinguish them when we get there she says planemos short for planetary mass objects are a cross between a star and a planet astronomers compare them with a brown dwarf seen here surrounded by a swirling mass of planetforming dust and gas too lightweight to be stars but bigger than most planets a handful of hot young freefloating objects have the raw materials to make their own miniplanetary systems astronomers say these socalled planemos have discs of cosmic dust and gas circling them just like some young stars these kinds of discs contain the ingredients for planets astronomers believe earth and the other planets in our solar system were forged from such a disc but planemos short for planetary mass objects are unlike normal planets because they do not orbit stars says associate professor ray jayawardhana of the university of toronto he and other researchers present their findings at a meeting of the american astronomical society in calgary canada these things are not orbiting a star theyre by themselves jayawardhana says the researchers detected four newborn planemos just a few million years old in a starforming region about lightyears from earth a relative stones throw in cosmic terms a lightyear is about trillion kilometres the distance light travels in a year all four of these objects had dust discs around them the astronomers report scientists also found a discskirted planemo interacting with a brown dwarf a failed star even closer to earth just lightyears away such a planetsized object might have been expected to be pulled into orbit around the brown dwarf but instead the two revolve around each other and both have the makings for more satellites an eternal freeze these objects with several times the mass of the giant planet jupiter but times less massive than our sun are cosmic infants only a few million years old even jupiter had a disc when it was young and its dozens of moons were formed from the dust and gas it contained but earths rocky moon was probably born when our world collided with another heavenly body early on and mars moons were asteroids captured by the planets gravity planemos are a relatively new player on the cosmic scene filling the gap between the least massive stars and the most massive planets jayawardhana says these are the lowestmass brown dwarfs or really big giant planets especially when theyre young he says when young planemos are still warmed by the heat of formation and are more like stars he says but as they age these planetesque objects shrink and cool other researchers do not use the term planet to describe any satellites that might be formed around a planemo referring to these as moons or moonlets if such bodies do form they would be inhospitable to earthtype life if a satellite formed very close to a young planemo it might be temporarily warm enough for liquid water to exist but jayawardhana acknowledges that in the long run life would have dim prospects any kind of planet that forms around them is committed to an eternal freeze he says australian soccer fans might not be disappointed according to statistical analysis of the socceroos chances in the world cup australia has roughly the same chance of winning the world cup as you have tossing three sixes with three dice says a sports statistician professor stephen clarke a researcher at swinburne university says australia has a to one or chance of winning the final this is not bad and nowhere near as small as the chance of being killed in a terrorist attack or winning the lottery he says its slightly more than flipping eight heads in a row in or tossing three sixes with three dice in while australia goes into the world cup as an underdog clarke says statistically speaking the nature of soccer gives the weaker side a chance he says if one team is expected to kick two goals in a match and another is expected to only kick one the stronger side still only has a chance of winning with a chance of a draw the weaker team has an chance of winning function of rare events soccer is very variable he says in australian rules football suppose one team kicks on average a goal every minutes and the other team kicks on average a goal every five minutes the chances the weaker team will kick more goals than the other team is quite small but in soccer it doesnt work that way because goals are much rarer its a function of rare events he says australia has a chance of making it through to the second round predictions on various teams chances at making various stages of the world cup are posted on the swinburne sports statistics website they were formulated by andrew patterson a former honours student turned professional punter and consultant number cruncher at the latest analysis the figures showed perennial favourite brazil has a chance of winning followed by england with a chance according to pattersons analysis australia the same chance of winning as the ivory coast and serbia and montenegro trinidad and tobago is ranked at the bottom of the ladder with a demoralising chance of winning the world cup factoring in public opinion patterson worked out the statistics using odds from an international online betting exchange and ran them through a computer model taking into account the structural peculiarities of the world cup competition and other factors ive taken a combination of the publics opinion as well as past data and my own statistical expertise to come up with a statistical model that predicts a teams chances he says his model will update predicted outcomes as the tournament progresses patterson says his analysis also puts australia as favourite to win its opener against japan on june i put the two sides into the computer and based on how they currently stand theres a chance australia will win and a chance that japan will win he says when we factor a draw in we come up with australia japan the draw its pretty much a hedged result the world cup kicks off on june patients who take an active role in managing their own health may still need help in the decisionmaking process researchers say when faced with a tough medical decision imagine that youre making it for a friend rather than for yourself a new study suggests that may make such choices easier report scientists in the june issue of the journal of general internal medicine we think that its understandably easy to get caught up in the difficulty of the moment a patient has just been diagnosed with a problem theyre facing a complex treatment decision its hard to see the big picture says dr brian zikmundfisher of the university of michigan its actually relatively easy for people to gain a different type of perspective by thinking about what they would do if they were recommending for someone else zikmundfisher and his team looked at a phenomenon known as omission bias this is when a person faced with a medical decision may choose passive nonintervention rather than an active approach due to fear of causing harm to themselves the researchers asked people to imagine themselves as a patient a doctor treating a patient a medical director creating patient guidelines or a parent making a decision for a child the people in the study were then asked to make medical choices in two different scenarios in one there is a deadly flu circulating that will kill of people who arent vaccinated although the vaccine itself carries a risk of causing death in the second participants were asked to decide on whether or not to treat a slowgrowing cancer with chemotherapy changing hats study participants were more likely to choose the active approach when making a decision as a professional rather than for themselves some of those imagining themselves as doctors would opt for the vaccine compared to of those posing as medical directors and making the decision for themselves a total of of those taking the physician or medical director role opted for chemotherapy compared to of those in the patient role thinking as parents of study participants would choose the vaccine for their child and would opt for chemotherapy this suggests zikmundfisher says that if a child is already sick a parent may feel more comfortable choosing active treatment than when making the decision to choose preventive but potentially risky treatment for a healthy child advice from doctors doctors are increasingly allowing patients to be a part of the decisionmaking process zikmundfisher notes but the findings suggest they shouldnt opt out of advising patients entirely the physician might be able to act as a coach to help guide the decision making process he says doctors could propose that patients try to think of themselves as making the decision for a friend he explains helping the patient to take a step back might make for a better decisionmaking process all around feeling itchy genes and gender help determine an individuals urge to scratch an itch suggests a new study the study on pruritus otherwise known as itch is the first to demonstrate sex differences in itchinduced scratching behaviour in animals the researchers studied mice but they say the findings could apply to humans and other mammals the conclusion females scratched themselves more often than males did we havent investigated the underlying mechanisms of the sex difference yet but they usually involve gonadal reproductive gland hormones such as oestrogen progesterone and testosterone either during development or in adulthood says professor jeffrey mogil one of the researchers mogil a specialist in the genetics of pain at mcgill university in canada and his colleagues induced itching in the mice by administering chloroquine a malaria drug that causes itchiness the researchers also used histamines compounds produced by mammalian tissues to dilate small blood vessels histamines are largely responsible for the itchiness associated with allergies hence the relief provided by antihistamines the teams findings are published online in the journal pain mogil says itch is one of the most common reasons people seek medical care he explains that pruritus is an important symptom of many skin systemic and autoimmune diseases numerous medications such as the malaria drug administered to the mice cause itching as a troubling side effect itching can also be a chronic condition in its own right are you in pain the most common reason people seek medical attention of course is pain interestingly enough mogil and his team found that individuals sensitive to pain are more resistant to itch while those with less pain sensitivity have a greater tendency to scratch i think pain and itch are wired up in the brain as opposites in a sense such that inheriting particular forms of painitchrelevant genes would simultaneously make you more sensitive to pain and less sensitive to itch or vice versa he speculates the researchers pointed out that scratching to the point of pain is a wellknown strategy for alleviating itch conversely pain medications and local anesthesia often intensify histamineinduced itching women feel the pain the painitch correlation however is complicated by findings from another study last year in the journal plastic and reconstructive surgery which found that women feel pain more intensely than men do dr bradon wilhelmi a plastic surgeon who authored the paper discovered that women have on average nerve fibres per square centimetre of facial skin while men only possess around nerve fibres over the same area because women have more nerve receptors they may experience pain more powerfully than men requiring different surgical techniques treatments or medicine dosages to help manage their pain and make them feel comfortable wilhelmi says it could be that women are more sensitive than men to both pain and itch or that women have evolved some level of pain tolerance perhaps due to giving birth mogil hopes future research will show which genes turn the urge to itch up or down how the proteins made by those genes work and how the same genes may be linked to pain sensitivity isisfordia was a small crocodile only a metre long weighing around or kilograms a new fossil from the age of the dinosaurs suggests modern crocodiles first evolved in gondwana says an international team of palaeontologists the team reports on the fossilised remains of the most primitive ancestor of modern crocodiles discovered near an outback australian town in queensland in the royal society journal proceedings b today up until now the kinds of creatures that seemed to be the ancestors or close to the ancestors of all modern crocodiles have come from places like belgium from england from the usa says team member dr paul willis so thats where we thought the group originated but he says the new specimen isisfordia duncani shares more features in common with modern crocodiles than any specimens found in the northern hemisphere it really defines that branch of crocodile evolution more clearly than anything else weve come across to date says willis an honorary research associate at sydneys university of new south wales the researchers say that at to million years old isisfordia predates modern crocodiles by about million years ours is the granddaddy of crocodiles says willis ball and socket joints modern crocodiles are defined by having ball and socket joints between their vertebrae and willis says this gives them a very flexible yet strong backbone crocodiles have incredible bursts of very violent energy and so you need a strong backbone to be able to withstand that he says modern crocodiles also have a hard palate that reaches right to the back of the mouth which means they can breathe at the same time as eating something under water says willis the palate also strengthens the snout bracing it and distributing forces when the crocodile bites something crocodile bites are second only to tyrannosaurus as the most powerful known bites of all time says willis willis says all these features would have given isisfordia and its descendants greater evolutionary advantage than its predecessors in aquatic environments complete skeleton willis and colleagues analysed two fossilised skeletons first discovered in the mids in a creek bed in isisford in centralwestern queensland by former deputy mayor of the town ian duncan one specimen is almost a complete skeleton with just the snout and face of the crocodile missing the other is a complete skull between the two we have a complete skeleton says willis we know what the whole animal looked like and its very rare to get that the researchers know the two are from the same species because they have the back of the skull of both a small croc isisfordia was a small crocodile only a metre long weighing around or kilograms says willis he says it was the only known crocodile in australia at that time and wouldnt have had much competition willis says it would have lived in a swampy river delta that opened into a large inland sea and survived on eating among other things fish and other small vertebrates insects and crustaceans isisfordia would have been the most immediate ancestor of all modern crocodilians says willis this includes crocodiles alligators and creatures such as gharials long thinsnouted crocodiles that live in the ganges river and caimans close relatives of alligators from south america gondwana overlooked willis says this is not the first time that gondwana has been overlooked as a site of evolution the fossil record is loaded to the northern hemisphere because there are more sites and more people looking for fossils he says but as were finding more fossils in the gondwanan continents it appears that a lot of groups that we previously thought originated in the northern hemisphere or in laurasia actually have older representatives here in the southern continents and in this case in australia willis is a reporter on abc tvs catalyst program female black swans slip away from their protective partners for illicit encounters new research shows swans have long been viewed as a symbol of fidelity and everlasting love but they are in fact cheating philanderers that regularly flee the nest for extramarital sex australian researchers reveal dna testing has shown that one in six cygnets is the product of an illicit encounter smashing the birds monogamous image now researchers at the university of melbournes zoology department are trying to establish how the females manage to slip away from their partners who are renowned for being protective to mate on the side swans have long been renowned as symbols of lifelong fidelity and devotion but our recent work has shown that infidelity is rife among black swans says dr raoul mulder whose team is busy fitting tracking devices to scores of swans mulder says dna paternity testing points to extramarital activity among swans but it remains unclear how the illicit encounters take place in an effort to learn more up to male swans at melbournes albert park lake are being fitted with a tiny microchip attached to their tail feathers the females in turn are being fitted with a miniature tracking device known as a decoder when a male and female copulate the females decoder unit detects the microchip implanted in the males tail feathers registering the males identity as well as the time of copulation mulder says all mating events are logged onto the decoder unit so that a complete record of her mating behaviour over several weeks can be downloaded when the swan is recaptured mulder says the study targets black swans because they are large enough to wear the tracking device and are more common than their introduced white cousins as well as providing a snapshot of the sexual activity of swans the research could reveal extremely sophisticated mating choices by the female birds mulder says there are risks associated with mating with other birds so there must be some evolutionary benefits he says the study could point to ways in which females try to ensure the fitness of their offspring by seeking out the superior genes of another mating partner he adds the threeyear a us study is funded by a grant from the australian research council the crab nebula with a central pulsar surrounded by rings of highenergy particles an astrophysicist who helped first identify pulsars and mentored many of australias radio astronomers has been honoured in the queens birthday honours list professor phillip pip hamilton deputy vicechancellor research at deakin university will today be honoured for his contribution to radioastronomy and tertiary education pulsars are collapsed stars that can emit regular pulses of radio waves several times a second and were discovered just as hamilton was completing his phd in he says at the time pulsars were dubbed lgm lgm stands for little green men because the pulsing signal looked like something that was very very regular he says it had to be artificial didnt it because no one had ever seen these things before but after four or five pulsars had been found hamilton says the little green men theory didnt hold up anymore and today there are about five or six hundred known pulsars hamilton spent years studying pulsars and recalls one occasion where he was involved with a team using the parkes telescope to take a second look at a suspicious sighting made by another telescope we actually discovered this pulsar a very interesting object in the middle of a thunderstorm he says thats very exciting stuff hamilton describes himself as half engineer and has had major involvement in designing several telescope control systems including that at parkes and the radio telescopes of the university of tasmania im a handson person if something breaks down in the office im there before anybody else with a screwdriver in the hand he says debris disc around beta pictoris showing light reflected by dust around the young star astronomers have discovered a solar system that seems like an early version of our own the us space agency says it has huge quantities of carbon gas mixed with a cloud of dust surrounding a young yellow star called beta pictoris the star and its emerging solar system in which planets could already be forming is less than million years old say the researchers the abundance of carbon gas in the dust disc surrounding the star means that the planets being formed could be rich in graphite and methane much like those of our solar system in the early stages they say the astronomers led by dr aki roberge of nasas goddard flight center is published in the journal nature there is much much more carbon gas than anyone expected roberge says could this be what our own solar system looked like when it was young are we seeing the formation of new types of worlds either prospect is fascinating the astronomers made their observations using the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer satellite launched in beta pictoris first discovered in beta pictoris is located in our galaxy is lightyears from earth and has been measured at times the suns mass images of beta pictoris taken by the orbiting hubble space telescope show it could have a jupitertype planet already and possibly also rocky planets in the course of formation astronomers say restricting an infants diet without a clinical diagnosis of food allergy could place him or her at risk researchers say parents are more likely to think their infant is allergic to certain foods than is actually the case according to a new uk study dr taraneh dean of the university of portsmouth and her colleagues found that more than half of a group of oneyearolds were avoiding some foods because their parents perceived them to have had reactions to items such as cows milk wheat eggs or additives but overall only of the infants had clinically confirmed food hypersensitivity the researchers report in the journal of allergy and clinical immunology dean and her team surveyed a group of parents when their infants were three six nine and months of age at one year the infants underwent skin prick testing to investigate their sensitivity to a number of allergens during the course of the study infants whose parents reported symptoms of food hypersensitivity had a test known as an open food challenge if these challenges suggested food hypersensitivity the children then underwent doubleblind placebocontrolled food challenges which are considered the gold standard in diagnosing food hypersensitivity at three months of age according to parental reports of infants had adverse reactions to food while did by one year of age among all the children almost had been reported at some point by their parents to have food hypersensitivity but open food challenges identified food hypersensitivity in just and doubleblind placebo controlled testing confirmed it in skin prick testing found just of the children had sensitivity to milk egg fish peanut sesame or wheat the findings emphasise the need for accurate diagnosis to prevent infants being on unnecessarily restricted diets which may be associated with inadequate nutrition in this important period of growth and development the researchers conclude a new sensor made of nanomaterials could give robots a sense of touch like we have with our fingers a new type of sensor may one day give robots the power to feel surfaces and perform delicate operations in the same way that human hands do today say us researchers vivek maheshwari and professor ravi saraf of the department of chemical engineering at the university of nebraska in lincoln report on the new device in todays issue of the journal science they say their sensor could give a robot tactile sensitivity comparable to that of human fingers robots equipped with such sensors could be used in minimally invasive surgery where tiny incisions and tiny tools are used to target very specific areas in the body the new sensor is an electroluminescent film that glows in response to pressure and texture when an object is pressed into the film the light from the film is captured by a specialised camera and translated into a picture sensor feels out a coin to illustrate the power of their new sensor maheshwari and saraf pressed coins against the device a us penny produced an image detailed enough to show the wrinkles in the clothing of abraham lincoln who is pictured on the coin and the letters ty in liberty a robots hands could be coated with the sensor film and the signals received could be used to guide the robot in performing surgery say the researchers in the same way that surgeons now use their sense of touch to find tumors or gallstones moreover there is great interest in developing humanoid robots that can sense shapes textures and hardness and manipulate complex objects which are not readily possible by vision alone say maheshwari and saraf their new film is made of alternating layers of gold and semiconducting cadmiumsulfur nanoparticles separated by nonconducting or dielectric films nanoparticles are extremely tiny a nanometer or a billionth of a metre or less in diameter dr richard crowder of the school of electronics and computer science at the university of southampton in the uk says the development of tactile sensors is one of the key technical challenges in advanced robotics and minimally invasive surgery the unique sensor developed by maheshwari and saraf could prove to be a key advance in technology for reasons including relatively simple construction apparent robustness and high resolution he says in an accompanying editorial in science researchers say theyve cured bubble boy disease in dogs and this has implications for humans with the genetic abnormalityimage istockphoto a new treatment has cured basset hounds with bubble boy disease a lifethreatening genetic disorder that disables the immune system according to a recent study the disease called xlinked severe combined immunodeficiency xscid affects male dogs and around in boys all of whom inherit a faulty gene from one of their mothers xchromosomes the dog study suggests the new treatment may become available to people in future at present there is only one treatment for the disease which was brought to the publics attention in a popular film called the boy in the plastic bubble starring john travolta he played david vetter a young man who spent his entire life in a sterilised environment the reallife vetter died in new approaches boys diagnosed with the condition are given bonemarrow transplants that can replenish stem cells responsible for renewing new functional immune cells gene therapy in which the individuals own bone marrow cells are cultured in a lab with the normal gene showed some success in treating of boys during a french study but three of the test subjects later developed leukaemia related to the process although exvivo outside of the body gene therapy has been shown to be capable of restoring normal immune function in xscid boys there are several potential problems with this approach says dr peter j felsburg who led the recent work and is a professor of immunology at the university of pennsylvania s school of veterinary medicine felsburg and his colleagues tried a new approach by directly injecting the corrected gene via an engineered virus into the bloodstream of four bubble boy basset hounds three of the four dogs have maintained healthy immune systems over a year after receiving the genes the fourth dog received a lower dosage which suggests there is a lower limit to the dose before the gene can restore immunity the findings were published recently in the journal blood too early to say its safe jennifer puck who is a researcher in the division of immunology and rheumatology at the university of california san francisco is a leading expert on xscid and related immunodeficiency diseases at the april conference primary immunodeficiencies past present future puck presented information on a new method she and her colleagues have developed for diagnosing the diseases in young infants puck says the basset hound treatment is a great idea but its application to humans is far in the future it is still way too early to say that it is safe she explained that the french children who developed leukaemia did not become ill until months after the treatment puck however welcomes new methods for curing immunodeficiency diseases which can affect both boys and girls xscid which only affects boys is just one of many related conditions newborns affected with severe immunodeficiency look completely healthy at first because they have antibodies from their mother puck says unfortunately something really serious has to happen before the genetic disease is suspected but by then the baby often is not in good shape she hopes universal screening soon will look for the diseases in all babies when they have their blood tests shortly after birth stargazers hope to learn more about pluto and its moons during the occultation earth and pluto will move exactly in line with a star in a rare astronomical event known as an occultation occultations occur when one celestial body moves in front of another hiding it from view the event during which a faint star catalogued as ucac will be occulted by pluto will occur at aest on june june utc and will last less than two minutes teams of astronomers have travelled from around the world to view the occultation the main visibility areas will be in new zealand and southern australia amateur astronomers with large telescopes will also be attempting to view the occultation good weather conditions permitting the shadow cast by pluto the smallest and most distant planet in the solar system as it tracks across the earth is only kilometres wide the same as its diameter learning more about pluto the occultation will help explain some of the mysteries of plutos nitrogen atmosphere and whether it has a system of rings similar to saturn astronomers say it also offers one of only a few opportunities to obtain data to finetune experiments on nasas new horizons space mission due to reach pluto in dr mark buie from lowell observatory in the us and a leading authority on occultations says the occultation could provide new insights into conditions on pluto if the planet had no atmosphere when it moved in front of the star the star would disappear instantly he says but an atmosphere refracts the light a little it gets spread out so we see the star get gradually fainter as it goes behind pluto the signature of that light curve how it diminishes with time allows us to measure fundamental properties of the atmosphere what its made of its temperature and how extensive it is new zealand observations of a pluto occultation in first confirmed that pluto had an atmosphere and new data will give scientists an idea about what happens to plutos atmosphere as it gets further from the sun weve only seen pluto through a quarter of one orbit says buie and some models predict that the atmosphere will freeze right out wed like to test that the event is even more significant because of the recent discovery of two new satellites to add to plutos moon charon that would be fantastically exciting because it would give us a shot at constraining their size buie says detailed information about the occultation can be found here hormonal changes linked to the seasons may change the shape of your body during the year seasonal changes cause fat to shift locations in our body altering the shape of our figures at certain times of the year according to a new study varying testosterone levels drive the shape changes the study which has been accepted for publication in the upcoming issue of psychoneuroendocrinology suggests the hormone often associated with brawn and aggressiveness fluctuates over the seasons in both men and women the most evident changes occur around the waist and hip region the study says when testosterone levels rise women became less curvy and fat shifts toward the waist other research has determined that the opposite happens in men who retain more fat in the abdominal region when testosterone levels fall the scientists examined seasonal testosterone fluctuations in the saliva of women and men they also measured the waists and hips of the female study participants over the seasons women more curvaceous in winter we found that womens and mens testosterone is highest in autumn says sari van anders a phd student at canadas simon fraser university who led the research as well womens waisttohip ratio how big the waist is relative to the hips is highest during autumn and central measures of fat deposition like abdominal fat were also somewhat higher in autumn for women women also had high testosterone levels in summer men showed lowest testosterone levels in spring van anders a doctoral candidate in behavioural neuroendocrinology says this suggests that patterns of fat deposition but not overall fat are slightly different depending on the season with more fat being deposited in the central waist region in autumn in women the study suggests women look more curvaceous in winter and spring men van anders says look manlier during spring when waist and hip size becomes more uniform and less feminine while we didnt test this a large body of previous research has found that men find lower waisttohip ratios in women more attractive in western nations van anders says as well a large body of research finds that lower waisttohip ratios are associated with better fertility parameters and health parameters this suggests that women should be perceived as slightly less attractive in autumn the researchers dont know whether the changes are apparent on a conscious or subconscious level since they occur gradually over time and do not dramatically alter appearance its all about reproduction randy nelson a professor of psychology and neuroscience at ohio state university and one of the worlds leading experts on how the seasons affect humans and animals says the study is a novel and important finding there have been previous demonstrations of seasonal changes in hormones including testosterone in humans as well as seasonal influences on the timing of conception he says about years ago a graduate student of mine even showed seasonal changes in cognitive performance among people the scientists are not sure why these fluctuations in body shape exist van anders says the changes might be byproducts of testosterone changing seasonally for reasons unrelated to waisttohip ratio such as health immune function fertility and behaviour a vacuumbased robot could climb tall buildings more efficiently than those with suction caps and claws its designer says a wallclimbing robot could replace people in building inspections and one day survey urban war zones where corners rooftops and building materials thwart otherwise capable robots the city climber rover being developed by professor jizhong xiao and his team at the city college of new york uses a vacuum chamber to get vertical the robot is part of a project that aims to automate mandatory building inspections new york city mandates that the facades of buildings be inspected every five years says xiao but the current manual inspection is timeconsuming and the cost is very high xiao thinks his robot can do the job faster cheaper and more thoroughly than trained technicians who typically perform their gravitydefying work from suspended scaffolding conventional robotic wall climbers typically employ more superherolike methods sticky feet suction cups claws or magnets but those grippers are only as good as the surface they make contact with suction cups or sticky feet for example work best on smooth surfaces such as glass or marble but not so well on brick clawed toes clamber well over rock and brick but slip on glass whats more such devices tend to move tentatively and cannot navigate over a variety of textured surfaces vacuum technology getting a robot to both cling to a wall and maneuver effortlessly over it are among the two biggest challenges that face researchers focused on wallclimbing robots says professor ning xi director of the laboratory of robotics and automation at michigan state university in both aspects the city climber is probably the best in the world right now says xi who is not associated with the project the one kilogram device clings to the wall by way of a vacuum rotor located in the centre of its underbelly the rotors impeller draws air in from the centre of the device and spews it out toward the edges the column of circulating air creates a region of low air pressure inside the vacuum chamber because the surrounding air pressure is higher it pushes down on the device keeping it tight to the wall small wheels on the underbelly of the device drive the robot forward and back by linking two triangularshaped modules with a hinged arm the researchers were able to make the city climber manoeuver around degree angle corners and transition from a wall to a roof all with the strength to pull or carry a payload four times its weight they have achieved one of the highest payloads reported in the literature says professor nikos papanikolopoulos of the university of minnesota xiao plans to equip his rover with a highresolution digital camera the good news is that beer may prevent prostate cancer the bad news is that youll destroy your liver if you drink enough to have any effect one of the main ingredients in beer appears to thwart prostate cancer according to findings released by us researchers but you would have to quaff more than pints to imbibe a medically effective dose of xanthohumol the apparently cancerfighting antioxidant found in hops says researcher emily ho from my studies you would have to drink an awful lot of beer says ho assistant professor of health and human science at oregon state university so the counter effects of the alcohol may outweigh any health benefits from drinking beer coauthor fred stevens of the universitys college of pharmacy says its feasible to make pills containing concentrated doses of xanthohumol or to bump up the level of the chemical in hops scientists in germany have already brewed up a beer containing ten times as much xanthohumol as found in traditional recipes stevens says the brew is being marketed in germany as a healthy beer but any effect on cancer rates is yet to be shown he says beer and pizza richard atkins head of the us national prostate cancer coalition says tomato sauce is also believed to be an effective cancer fighter this means that beer and pizza could be a winning anticancer formula its every mans dream to hear that beer and pizza can prevent cancer he says bur our hope is that men know the facts and get tested for prostate cancer food no matter how helpful it may be is not a full preventive for prostate cancer while the research regarding xanthohumol is promising ho cautions that further study is necessary the one caveat is that all our work is done in a laboratory system using cultured cells with purified compounds she says now for more good news meanwhile a separate study has found that drinking coffee may help prevent the liver disease alcoholic cirrhosis the study of more than people found that for each cup of coffee they drank per day participants were nbsp less likely to develop alcoholic cirrhosis these data support the hypothesis that there is an ingredient in coffee that protects against cirrhosis especially alcoholic cirrhosis concludes the report from the kaiser permanente medical care program in oakland the authors said they could not determine whether it was caffeine or another ingredient in coffee which had the protective effect the study is published in the american medical associations archives of internal medicine the authors say the findings dont suggest heavy drinkers should rely on coffee to prevent alcoholic cirrhosis even if coffee is protective the primary approach to reduction of alcoholic cirrhosis is avoidance or cessation of heavy alcohol drinking they say the findings do not preclude the possibility of increased risk of suicide among small populations of individuals the researchers say newer antidepressant drugs may not raise the risk of suicide as previously suggested say researchers who document a drop in suicide rates in the us since the drugs were introduced dr julio licinio of the university of miami and colleagues report in the june issue of the journal public library of science medicine that the new ssri antidepressants could have saved more than lives our findings certainly suggest that the introduction of ssris has contributed to reduction of suicide rates in the united states says licinio who did the study while at the university of california los angeles however the findings do not preclude the possibility of increased risk of suicide among small populations of individuals millions of people use ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors including pfizers zoloft glaxosmithklines paxil and the first drug of this type eli lillys prozac or fluoxetine warnings the us food and drug administration introduced black box warnings on the most popular ssris in after studies in the us and britain suggested the drugs may raise the risk of suicidality in children and adults although the current issue concerning antidepressants and suicidality requires further examination we believe that many more lives have been saved than lost since the advent of these drugs say licinio and team suicidality is defined by feelings thoughts and behaviours related to suicide but the researchers say actual deaths caused by suicide are a better measure of whether there is a benefit from antidepressants licinios team studied federal data to show the us suicide rate held steady for years prior to the introduction of prozac in then dropped steadily over years as sales of the antidepressant rose the research team found the strongest effect among women mathematical modelling of probable suicide rates from to based on pre data suggests fewer people have committed suicide since prozac hit the market licinio says the actual suicide rates fluctuated between and suicides per people until and then gradually fell to the lowest per in licinios team reports during that time prescriptions of fluoxetine ballooned from about million in to more than million in study does not prove benefit in a commentary on the new study associate professor bernhard baune and professor philippa hay of james cook university in australia say the type of study performed by lucinio and colleagues cannot prove for certain whether antidepressants do harm or good at a population level but they say that the study does not support an association between increased suicide and increased fluoxetine prescription rates licinios team acknowledges there may have been other reasons why the suicide rate declined their research was funded by the national institutes of health and the dana foundation and did not have any pharmaceutical company funding the researchers declare no competing interests licinio accepted an offer to consult for eli lilly after the research was accepted for publication is the whinny a horse makes when it sees someone it likes different from the one it makes when it sees someone it doesnt like a new database of horse talk and behaviour could help take the mystery out of a horse whisperers job us researchers hope physicist david browning an adjunct professor at the university of rhode island and dr peter scheifele a research associate at the university of connecticut are compiling the database in an attempt to correlate nuances in horse whinnies with their differences stress levels they announced their equine vocalization project last week at an acoustical society of america meeting in providence rhode island the information could help shed light on the communication styles of other equines such as donkeys and zebras and even improve how veterinarians behaviourists breeders or other animal handlers relate to horses you would like to find that you get a particular whinny for a particular situation says browning snorts blows sighs and whinnies unlike the monotonal vocalisations of cows goats and sheep horses emit a range of sounds from snorts blows and sighs to whinnies which also come in the form of nickers and squeals brownings initial acoustical studies have shown that whinnies have the greatest changes in frequency and could contain information about specific situations when horses are stressed their vocalisations peak into a highpitched screams when they are calm their whinnies modulate in the middle tones but scientists are still not sure if the changes in frequency can be connected to more specific conditions browning and scheifele have begun compiling their database of horse vocalisations from their own recordings and from those of other researchers the vocalisations are analysed with acoustic software that plots the sound over time they have been categorising the vocalisations by behaviour in order to answer some basic questions for example horses have a good memory and can recognise friends both human and horse browning would like to know if the whinny they make when they see someone they like is different from one they make upon seeing someone they dont like zebras that bark like a dog as part of the project browning will also be collecting vocalisations of three species of zebra one that brays like a donkey one that whinnies like a horse and one that barks like a dog to try and get a more complete picture of equine vocalisations dr sarah ralston an associate professor at the equine science center at rutgers university isnt sure how much the study will contribute to the practicality of handling horses but she does think that comparing the vocalisation of horses and zebras could provide some insight into the social organisation of different equines one zebra is like a horse with harems and lives in groups whereas another is more solitary differences in vocalisations might reflect differences in the social organisation she says if all the earths gold was on the surface we could be kneedeep in the stuff says researcher theres enough gold buried deep within the earths core to cover the entire land surface of the planet to a depth of half a metre an australian researcher says professor bernard wood a geologist from macquarie university in sydney made his remarkable calculations based on research published in todays issue of the journal nature wood and colleagues chart the early history of our earths development starting with the birth of the solar system more than billion years ago in particular they focus on the formation of earths molten metal core by looking at other stars that are currently at the state our sun was in then we can see that they are surrounded by a flattened disc of dust and gas wood says we know that within about years these formed into small bodies that were about kilometres across radioactive dating has shown that over the next to one million years those small planetesimals collided to form moontomars sized planetary embryos within to million years larger planets had formed in the case of earth it was around million years wood says magma ocean early in its history the earth was probably covered in a sea of molten rock hundreds of kilometres deep during the planets development this magma ocean reacted with metals in the planetesimals extracting many of the most important and interesting elements including gold and eventually depositing them in the earths own ironrich core to calculate how much gold was in the earths core wood compared the composition of the earths crust with that of meteorites which can be used to represent planetesimals he and other researchers have found that the meteorites had similar levels of all elements that would not normally dissolve in iron but they also noted that meteorites had higher levels of elements such as gold platinum and nickel this tells us that the earth is chemically very similar to those meteorites but the earths crust is depleted in all those elements that like to dissolve in iron wood says theres only one place those elements can have gone the molten core we can say that more than of the earths gold is in the core wood says its a nice image to think we could all step outside and be kneedeep in the stuff passenger air travel is growing at the rate of around a year and could account for of manmade co emissions by restrictions on night flights could ease the aviation industrys fastgrowing contribution to global warming say uk scientists dr nicola stuber and fellow meteorologists at the university of reading report their findings in todays issue of the journal nature at certain altitudes aircraft produce contrails condensation trails caused when the planes hot exhaust hits the chilly atmosphere these contrails have a surprisingly big but also complex effect on the climate because they are clouds they trap heat that is emitted by the earths surface creating a greenhouse effect that adds to warming yet during daytime these clouds have a cooling effect because they are white and thus reflect some of the suns energy back into space in certain conditions contrails can exist for several hours stuber and team estimate the radiation caused by contrails at a busy flight corridor in southeast england using highresolution aircraft flight data and routine weather balloon data they looked at persistent contrails wakes that remained for an hour or more after the aircraft had flown over night flights account for only of britains annual air traffic but contribute between to of the greenhouse effect from contrails the scientists found winter flights warm more stuber and team also found that flights during the winter months could contribute more to global warming we also found that flights between december and february contribute half of the annual mean climate warming even though they account for less than a quarter of annual air traffic says stuber although there are fewer flights during the winter months the conditions needed to form contrails the right temperature amount of moisture in the air and aircraft altitude are found more often then a growing problem global emissions of manmade co are between billion and billion tonnes per year added to this are around billion tonnes from land use commercial aircraft account for only a small contribution compared with power stations industry and road traffic however passenger travel is growing at the rate of around a year which means that this share will grow fast a estimate by the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc found that the airline industry accounted for of manmade co emissions in but it would rise to as much as by environmentalists are angry complaining that airlines get a free ride when it comes to environmental taxes changing altitude could also help in addition to rescheduling night flights for the daytime planes could diminish their contribution to global warming by changing their altitude a study published last year in the journal transportation research suggests that the regions of icesupersaturated air where contrails form is only about metres thick the goal would be to fit sensors on aircraft that could inform pilots where this layer lies thus enabling them to shift altitude accordingly ansto says the radiation released from its site was well within regulatory limits and will not affect the health of workers or the community the operator of australias only nuclear reactor has rejected claims that radioactivity released from its site raises safety concerns the opposition labor party claims the australian nuclear science and technology organisation ansto has withheld details about an accident at the lucas heights facility in sydney last week a pipe inside a hot cell used to produce medical isotopes ruptured last thursday evening disrupting production of radiopharmaceutical technetiumn used in the scanning of bones and organs only one worker was in the vicinity of the incident but after examination he has been found not to have received any radiation dose ansto said in a release at the time no measurable contamination was found outside the immediate area where the incident occurred and there are no offsite consequences but shadow minister for science and research jenny macklin said yesterday she had obtained an internal email from ansto that contained information not previously released by the organisation the email said a small amount of radioactive gases xenon and krypton had been released through the stack and the worker involved had received a very small amount of contamination the email said the radiation was quickly washed off the worker and a whole body monitor examination confirmed that he received no internal radiation exposure trivial incident in a followup statement this week ansto rejected macklins claims that it had not made relevant information about the incident public ansto described the incident as trivial although said it had nonetheless informed the regulator the australian radiation protection and nuclear safety agency small amounts of radioactive gases are routinely released during radiopharmaceutical manufacture and reported to the public via anstos annual environmental reports ansto said it also said that while the doses received by the public as a result of those releases are so low as not to be directly measurable they can be calculated the total maximum annual estimated dose to a member of the public from those releases is only a very small fraction of the radiation dose received by everyone each year from naturallyoccurring sources of radiation ansto said the releases which occurred last thursday evening were not outside the normal release pattern were well within regulatory limits and could not be detected offsite the statement said nuclear debate australia holds about of the worlds known uranium reserves and is a major exporter of the material there is currently debate in australia over government investigations into whether to set up a nuclear power and enrichment industry in the country accidents like this show that the community is right to be concerned about the safety of nuclear reactors macklin said this accident is a stark reminder that things can go wrong with nuclear reactors but ansto rejected macklins linking of last weeks incident with nuclear reactor safety the incident did not occur in the reactor and has nothing to do with reactor safety it said this is just deliberate scaremongering by labor in relation to a medical research reactor that delivers radioisotopes and radiopharmaceuticals to cancer patients across australia science minister julie bishop told abc radio news the yearold lucas heights plant is australias only nuclear reactor and produces radioisotopes for use in more than nuclear medicine procedures each year reconstruction of the ancient amphibious bird gansus yumenensis the most advanced early cretaceous bird yet discovered spectacular millionyearold fossils complete with threedimensional bones feathers and foot webbing suggest living birds evolved from waterfowl say researchers dr peter dodson professor of anatomy at the university of pennsylvania and team report in todays issue of the journal science on five partial skeletons found km west of beijing china called gansus yumenensis the pigeonsized bird probably resembled a tern or a loon webfooted fisheating birds the researchers say it would have been an accomplished flyer and diver and could well be one of the ancestors of modern birds gansus is very close to a modern bird and helps fill in the big gap between clearly nonmodern birds and the explosion of early birds that marked the cretaceous period the final era of the dinosaur age says dodson he says gansus is the oldest example of the nearly modern birds that branched off the trunk of the family tree that began with the famous protobird archaeopteryx which provided evidence that birds evolved from dinosaurs every bird living today from ostriches to bald eagles probably evolved from a gansuslike ancestor says team member dr matthew lamanna of carnegie natural history museum in pittsburgh rich fossil bed the fossils were found in an exceptionally rich fossil bed in chinas gansu province in a poor farming area near changma by an expedition led by team member dr hailu you of the chinese academy of geological sciences in the cretaceous period million years ago it would have been a lake surrounded by lush plant life filled with crocodiles and fish and with dinosaurs and early mammals prowling on land humans arent the only animal that weigh up costs and benefits rats like humans carefully weigh the costs and benefits of making certain decisions a new study has found the study accepted for publication in the journal behavioural brain research is the first to demonstrate this behaviour in nonhuman animals a person buying a new car for example must weigh the cost and the effort needed to make payments versus the value of the car rats and likely all rodents do something similar only under a lot more pressure in its natural habitat rats are facing the problem that little is under their control so they are facing various levels and forms of uncertainty all the time says study leader dr ruud van den bos of the faculty of veterinary medicine at utrecht university in the netherlands for instance the quality and amount of food items at patches varies over time and between different patches thus benefits are not always the same the amount of energy spent to obtain these different items varies during the different foraging sessions as sometimes its cold sometimes its hot sometimes it rains sometimes sudden obstacles are present after heavy storms etc tshaped maze forces rats to choose van den bos and team attempted to duplicate such challenges by manipulating barriers in a tshaped maze that rats explored the wistar rats a rodent developed for research entered at the bottom of the t which connected two arms at the end of each arm was a chamber filled with treats one side had a low reward one sugar pellet while the other side had three to five sugar pellets rats that wanted the higher rewards had to climb steep barriers it would be like placing a persons favourite dessert behind a high wall that would have to be scaled before the individual could nosh the researchers varied the size of the barrier and the amount of reward on that side to see how the rodents would react at first the rats went for the easy pickings but when they determined more sweets were available on the other side of the maze they exerted additional effort but only after a certain point when the pain yielded too little gain they stuck with the tiny treat the researchers also noted that rats seem to behave according to an internal constant standard a relative ratio for each situation by which choices are measured this is comparable to how a car purchaser may enter a dealership with a budget in mind since this standard varies depending on the situation it is possibly part inherent and part created by individuals rats could get depressed too dr john salamone professor and head of behavioural neuroscience at the university of connecticut developed the tmaze for previous studies he also recently authored a paper in current psychiatry reviews that determined problems in the brain associated with effortrelated processes such as how much energy an individual will put out to obtain a reward could be linked to depression this suggests rats get depressed too salamones own research indicates interference with dopamine a neurotransmitter chemical in the brain may make individuals less likely to work for rewards and biased toward loweffort alternatives exertion of effort and energy and energyrelated decisionmaking are fundamental for survival in humans and other animals and i am very happy that more and more people are getting involved in this sort of research says salamone who added the new work was an excellent piece of research migraines have been linked to a better sex drive being prone to migraine may improve some individuals libido according to new research a team led by dr timothy houle of wake forest university school of medicine in winstonsalem north carolina reports its findings in the june issue of the journal headache the goal of this research was to understand migraine better says houle by better understanding how the brain is altered with this syndrome we can develop better drugs in the future migraines have other commonly associated symptoms such as sleep abnormalities and a higher risk of depression altered sex drive may be another quirk of being a migraine he adds sex can alleviate migraine pain houle and team note that it is commonly believed that sex drive is reduced by headaches and sexual intercourse can cause specific types of headaches but they say other research has suggested that sexual intercourse may alleviate the pain of migraine in some patients the researchers tested the theory that migraine and sexual desire may both be associated with serotonin reduced libido often accompanies depression treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ssri which increases brain levels of serotonin whereas migraine is associated with reduced serotonin levels to investigate this complex relationship houle and team recruited adults who had at least headaches annually twentythree subjects men and women were classified as having migraine and men and women as having tensiontype headache the subjects completed the selfadministered sexual desire inventory sdi which allowed them to rate how much they think about sex and how much they desire sex men reported about higher sex drive than did women says houle and the difference between migraine and tensiontype headache was almost equivalent thus women with migraines reported about the same relative levels of sex drive as men with tension type headaches on the ninepoint scale the subjects specifically rated their own sexual desire compared with that of others of the same age and sex the migraine patients reported the highest level which is above the expected median on this item houle and team say those with tensiontype headaches gave themselves an average rating of for this item sexual desire still normal houle says the migraine patients were aware that they rated their sexual desire higher than that of other patients in the group but he adds there was no evidence that their sexual desire was beyond that of high normal or that they are hypersexual it can now be hypothesised that a serotonergic link may be implicated in both migraine headaches and sexual desire the researchers conclude serotonin receptors also appear to be involved in several aspects of sexual functioning on the other hand they point out that there are multiple classes and subtypes of serotonin receptors therefore they conclude that any neurochemical mechanisms that might link serotonin and migraine would likely be sophisticated and multifactorial the global iwc meeting has seen a pitched battle for control of the agenda between prowhaling nations and those who want whaling banned prowhaling nations have struck an historic blow against the moratorium on commercial hunting winning their first vote in favour of whaling for two decades the breakthrough came over the weekend at the member international whaling commissions annual meeting in the caribbean island state of st kitts and nevis the japanled prowhaling block is triumphant after forcing a resolution which brands the current ban no longer necessary the nonbinding resolution which has a one vote margin doesnt mean the yearold moratorium will be overturned but it signals that the prowhaling lobby might finally have the muscle to challenge the moratorium this is historic says said rune frovik secretary of norwegian prowhaling lobby the high north alliance for the first time in more than two decades the whaling commission expresses support for commercial whaling environmentalists meanwhile have labelled the latest vote tragic and say its their worstever defeat in the decadeslong antiwhaling campaign this is the most serious defeat the conservation cause has ever suffered at the iwc new zealands environment minister chris clark says the win is also a huge symbolic step forward for japan as it strives to lead prowhaling nations to a majority on the iwc federal environment minister ian campbell has criticised japans attempt to control the iwc the attempt by japan to turn the whaling commission back into a whaling club shows just how out of touch they are with world opinion he says long awaited success or major setback japan and its allies on the commission are triumphant savouring the firstever fruit of tokyos long diplomatic campaign to lift the ban on commercial whaling this is an historic victory says glenn inwood spokesperson for the japanese delegation this is the first serious setback the global moratorium has ever had it is only a matter of time before it is gone completely environmental campaigners meanwhile are reeling from the blow and some were close to tears after the vote this is the most significant setback since the moratorium came into force says kitty block a lawyer with humane society international focus on management not conservation the weekend resolution proposed by commission hosts st kitts and nevis passed by to votes with one abstention it declares the moratorium which was clearly intended as a temporary measure is no longer necessary the vote represents a major victory for prowhaling nations led by japan who want to turn the iwc away from pure conservation and focus on a return to managing whale stocks for hunting the moratorium enforced since still stands because it needs a nbsp majority to be overturned japan abides by the moratorium but conducts research whaling through what opponents say is a loophole in the iwc charter as does iceland norway ignores the moratorium all together around whales are taken by the three nations each year and more than whales have been hunted and killed since the moratorium japan hopes to use the resolution known as the st kitts and nevis declaration as a political weapon to argue that more states than not on the nation iwc body believe the commercial whaling ban should be lifted japan complains that antiwhaling states have deadlocked the commission which was set up in to prevent whales from passing into extinction through overhunting having a majority on the iwc will allow tokyo to control the commissions agenda for the first time since a moratorium was introduced and environmentalists fear let tokyo frustrate conservation efforts not all good news for whaling nations sue lieberman director of the global species program at wwf international says the vote should be a wakeup call what is more important than that is this does show that japans recruitment drive has finally succeeded she says but lieberman says japan was defeated in three far more substantial votes that preceded approval of the st kitts and nevis declaration in one japan sought to remove the issue of hunting dolphins and porpoises from the agenda of the meeting but failed by a vote in another japan lost its bid to introduce secret ballots something the group has never done for major initiatives in its year history officials say and in a third antiwhaling nations voted down tokyos request for coastal whalers to resume a small forprofit inshore minke whale hunt no they did not win when it really counted and no this isnt going to change anything lieberman says of the declaration this is purely inflammatory and will not help resolve what we agree is a serious impasse in the iwc an artificial nose may one day help doctors sniff out disease doctors in the future may sniff patients with an electronic nose to detect telltale odours released as a result of disease and illness the technology replicates human and animal olfactory systems according to a recent announcement by the european union information societys technologies program the mechanical sniffer currently undergoing development and testing could dramatically change how doctors diagnose illness the technology behind the device was inspired by the human nose but its effectiveness is comparable to more sensitive animal noses the human nose is not especially well suited for odour recognition as compared to the noses of dogs or rats says professor oacutescar ruiz who is working on the project ruiz from the department of electronics at the university of barcelona spain says there are some groups in the world that have trained dogs to diagnose some diseases like melanoma or prostate cancer in urine he says the sniffing device would do something similar only it would use bioelectric sensors sniffing out skin cancer the gadget consists of a layer of proteins designed to mimic natural olfactory receptors placed on a gold microelectrode mounted on a twomillimetrelong computer chip one end of the chip is immersed in a liquid cell containing additional microelectrodes all of which connect to an instrument that measures electrochemical changes at present the researchers are pumping odourcausing chemicals into the liquid cell to record the signature spectrums that result when the nose receptors encounter them skin cancer cells for example create distinctive electrochemical patterns as do bacterial infections failing organs and other tissue cells even when they are healthy so far the researchers have worked with an olfactory receptor protein from rats and one from humans the proposed electronic nose will need several hundred of such proteins to detect multiple smells the human nose for example uses different proteins that enable the brain to perceive approximately different smells in humans however the brain cannot seem to keep up with the nose the brain gets trained to recognise different odours but of course many of them are never recognised ruiz says the evolution of smell our hominid and ape ancestors actually had more keen noses since they relied more upon their sense of smell for mating socialising detecting predators finding food and other tasks scientists at the weizmann institute in rehovot israel have found that many genes for smell in humans were turned off permanently over the course of our evolution although the dna continues to exist as inactive pseudogenes ruiz and his team suggest that the electronic nose will return some of these smelling skills to us the invention may even improve upon nature at least in terms of precision and reliability we think that a commercial prototype could be available in between five and years although there are still some important issues to be solved he says initially we expect that the devices will work with body fluids like urine or blood a silent unmanned drone could help crack down on urban crime us police say police in the us have launched what they say is the future of law enforcement in the form of a drone aircraft bringing technology usually associated with combat zones to urban policing the unmanned aerial vehicle which looks like a childs remote control toy and weighs about kilograms is being tested by the los angeles county sheriffs department police say the skyseer drone will be able to accomplish tasks too dangerous for officers and free up helicopters for other missions the technology could be used to find missing children search for lost hikers or survey a fire zone says commander sid heal head of the technology exploration project of the los angeles county sheriffs department it will also be helpful in tracking down suspected burglars on rooftops and chasing down suspects fleeing on foot the drone is equipped with lowlight and infrared capabilities and can fly at speeds up to kilometres per hour for minutes hightech kite fits in a backpack the plane collapses and can fit into a shoulder pack smaller than a golf bag its basically a hightech kite that field officers could set up in a matter of minutes heal says a small camera capable of tilt and pan operations is fixed to the underside of the drone and sends the video directly to a laptop command station once launched the craft is set to fly autonomously with global positioning system gps coordinates and a fixed flight pattern as technology improves the drone will be outfitted with zoom capabilities for now the craft simply flies lower to hone in on its target police say the skyseers stealth quality is a big advantage the plane is virtually silent and invisible says heal it will give us a vertical perspective that we have never had he predicts that unmanned surveillance crafts will become the norm in urban policing sam de la torre designer of the drone at octatron industries has been working on the project for two years and says he has seen demand from other police forces is big brother watching you the skyseer isnt capable of spying into windows yet but privacy advocates say a future of surveillance by invisible eyes in the sky is an unsettling development a helicopter can be seen and heard and one can make behaviour choices based on that said beth givens of the privacy rights clearinghouse do we really want to live in a society where our backyard barbeques will be open to police scrutiny for now the sheriffs will continue trial runs of the skyseer to get a handle on its capabilities and work at fixing glitches in its operation including a communication interference that caused the high tech kite to nosedive and crash during a field test last week relationships family and social standing are all sources of stress for female baboons sound familiar female baboons get stressed about males and even suffer from premenstrual tension a new study shows according to the research the number one cause of stress for female chacma baboons papio hamadryas ursinus is when a new male enters a group and may threaten to bully and kill other baboons especially infants that suggests to me that females are highly aware of the risks presented by violent young males entering the troop says dr anne engh lead author of the study which was published recently in the journal animal behavior engh a researcher in the department of biology at the university of pennsylvania and her team studied approximately male and female baboons over a month period in botswanas moremi game reserve they collected faecal samples from females for stress hormone analysis prior research has found that glucocorticoids a class of steroid hormones rise when apes humans and other animals feel stress baboons get pmt too besides male immigration reproductive state predation rank instability and infanticide also triggered female stress the stress hormone rise during reproductive stages is normal and indicates that female apes like women could experience a potentially cranky pmt phase female baboons usually exist in stable hierarchical groups but the researchers observed two instances where low status females tried to pull rank and stress levels rose in one case an adult female her adult daughter and a sister all attempted to usurp the power of another unit after a week of fighting and high stress the lowerranked group gave up in the second period of observed instability an adult female named cat ran off with a highranked male for several days when she returned a catfight ensued with the other females the fights not only lowered the status of cat but also placed the unfortunate baboons daughter sisters aunt and their children to the bottom of the hierarchy our best guess is that poor cat just had very bad timing engh says when she left the troop with the alpha male more than half of the troops females were cycling so there was probably quite a bit of competition between the females to catch the alphas eye anxiety levels also rose when males attempting to assert their power killed infants for several days after an infants murder its mother would scream and flee whenever the killing male approached what can baboons teach us about stress engh says friendships with less aggressive males and grooming with females seems to reduce the females fear and stress professor joan silk a university of california at los angeles anthropologist noted for her work on the evolution of social behaviour in primates says she has worked at the same reserve where the new study took place and that this account seems consistent with what i know of the females there she says the results provide independent confirmation of the supposition that sociality has important consequences for females baboons in their natural habitat appear to cope with stress better than humans do engh says humans in contrast get stressed out about many things often things that are of little significance in our lives or are completely abstract threats she says we would probably be better off aping baboons and worrying only about the important things in our lives coral reefs have changed dramatically since the arrival of humans particularly in the last few decades coral reefs have suffered more damage since the s than any time in the last years according to a study that warns of the threats of overfishing and coastal development scientists from australia have found that coral reefs in the caribbean island of barbados were relatively unchanged for about years before the arrival of humans despite rising and falling sea levels but according to the paper published in ecology letters modern day reefs now look startlingly different and are dominated by algae and seaweed associate professor john pandolfi of the australian research councils centre of excellence for coral reef studies says human activity has made reefs far more susceptible to change when you compare that typical coral community in the geological past to the coral community that we see today in barbados its fundamentally different says pandolfi who led the study its clear that these modern coral reefs have been significantly altered and the only thing thats different is that humans are around we see that the impact of overfishing and coastal development has had a huge effect the likes of which we havent seen for hundreds of thousands of years overfishing takes its toll pandolfi studied the preserved remains of entire coral reef communities that lived in the caribbean up to years ago he analysed four periods in the reefs history when geological activity pushed it to the surface and wiped out the coral community each time the sea floor was recolonised and the coral reef returned in a very similar structure with the same species when we look at large scale perturbations in the fossil record such as global climate change and sea level changes when the reefs come back they appear to assemble in similar ways he says so through out the last couple of years weve had coral reefs in the island of barbados that are very much alike through time budget cuts at plant institutes and their gene banks pose the biggest threat to the worlds crops the architect of a massive seedsaving plan says work has begun on an agricultural noahs ark designed to preserve the genetic diversity of the worlds crops beneath the arctic permafrost for thousands of years dr cary fowler is the mastermind behind the socalled doomsday vault which will be carved deep in the side of a mountain in the svalbard archipelago kilometres from the north pole construction of the vault began this week built with top security the a million us million depository will preserve around three million seeds representing all known varieties of the worlds crops at subzero temperatures fowler is executive secretary of the global crop diversity trust an international nonprofit organisation that supports the worlds most critical crop collections currently scattered among some gene banks according to him the main threat to the worlds crops is probably not a nuclear war rather it is annual budget cuts at plant institutes and their gene banks around the world as well as the occasional power failure that thaws seeds so that they fail to germinate of course there is also a risk of wars and other catastrophes wiping out a whole institute but in most cases there are no big headlines when a variety is irrevocably lost he says convincing the world of the problem hasnt been easy fowler says but people get a perception of the magnitude of the loss when i tell them that at the end of the s named apple varieties were grown in the united states he says now of those are as extinct as the dinosaurs genetics of disaster fowler who earned a phd in social sciences at swedens uppsala university says his life changed in the early s when he read a paper by botanist jack harlan entitled genetics of disaster harlan was a plant explorer geneticist and breeder who understood crops their origins and their use in sustaining mankind his seed collections from countries are stored in gene banks throughout the world some samples have been returned to their home countries after they were lost from local gene banks his work inspired fowler what we will store on svalbard is not just one or two million seed samples and germ plasm but the work of countless generations of farmers for thousands of years fowler says our crops are the oldest artefacts in the world they are older than the pyramids and they are alive no nation has ever maintained a prosperous food system based on genetic resources of purely indigenous origin today maize a native of central america is the predominant food crop in southern africa soybean a species from china and east asia is now a major crop in the us and brazil fowler says lessons from the potato famine the bestknown case of a crop almost wiped out is the th century irish potato famine which led to more than a million deaths the country had relied on only one variety of one crop for its staple food and that variety had no resistance to disease there wasnt enough genetic diversity to provide protection fowler says without being able to go back to the many wild species and to the hundreds of farmers varieties from latin america none of us would be eating potatoes today the road to the svalbard vault was a long and bumpy one but fowler has played a major role at each stage from inventories of plant resources to resolving ownership issues this is the only major problem in the world right now that i say with a straight face we can actually solve this he says this is the one major problem we can fix put on the back burner and move on to something else the trust will work closely with the united nations food and agriculture organisation to help support gene banks around the world which will remain the first line of defence but the more i see of the various threats to crop diversity the better i feel about svalbard fowler says in or years the norwegian government of today may not be remembered for anything else than building the vault on svalbard such are the immense implications of the vault for the world the future looks a bit brighter for the giant panda there are many more giant pandas than previously thought say scientists who have been studying dna in panda faeces professor michael bruford of the cardiff university school of biosciences and professor fuwen wei of the institute of zoology the chinese academy of sciences led the study which is reported in the current issue of the journal current biology the giant panda is one of the worlds most elusive and endangered species the traditional way to estimate panda populations is to examine the faeces for the length of bamboo it contains bruford says researchers would then guess the pandas age and estimate how many different pandas the faeces had come from bruford says say the new method provides more accurate estimates of panda populations without dna profiling you are bound to underestimate he says brufords team surveyed square kilometres of a chinese reserve we really combed the reserve there were teams of people in a field walking in a line he says it was previously thought that giant pandas lived there but bufords team now thinks there are researchers urge against complacency he predicts that the results would be replicated in other panda reserves our results found that previous surveys underestimated the population by more than says bruford these findings indicate that the species has a much better chance of longterm viability although we must not become complacent since the population size is still perilously low bruford warns we still may be only talking about a few thousand individuals these guys are not common giant pandas traditional homes have been the mountains of central and southern china as well as myanmar and vietnam but their numbers have fallen to only around according to chinese estimates as their natural habitats have been destroyed by humans china founded its first nature reserve for giant pandas in the s and now has nature reserves for them according to the xinhua news agency it also has giant pandas in captivity while others have been sent to zoos around the world hwang woosuk south koreas disgraced cloning expert hwang woosuk went on trial this week on fraud embezzlement and ethical charges related to his faked stem cell research hwang once referred to as south koreas supreme scientist was indicted on may with five other scientists on charges in connection with the bogus research and the disappearance of millions of dollars in donations during the hearing prosecutors accused hwang of fabricating research data to obtain millions of dollars in funds this is a unique fraud case in the academic world he deceived our people and the world and embezzled research funds by using fabricated data they said in a statement some supporters of hwang disrupted the hearing with boos and shouts despite the presence of dozens of police inside and outside the court several times presiding judge hwang hyonjoo had to call the hearing to order and demand silence from the public apology hwang apologised through his lawyer while admitting he was partly responsible for the fradulent stemcell research featured in the and papers published in the us journal science hwang neglected his duty to oversee his research team the lawyer said hwang became a national hero when he claimed that he had created patientspecific stem cells in landmark research on cloning but a panel of experts at seoul national university where hwang worked as a professor concluded in january that the stemcell claims were bogus prosecutors said they had confirmed that hwangs claims regarding stem cells were fraudulent specifically they confirmed the academic panels conclusion that no cloned stem cells of any kind were ever created by hwang if convicted on all charges hwang could face up to five years in prison legal experts said the trial is expected to wrap up next month stem cells are master cells that have the potential to develop into any organ of the body scientists believe they could be used to fight illnesses including cancer diabetes and alzheimers disease a breast cancer cell around to of breast cancers are inherited a new gene has been identified that can greatly raise the risk of breast cancer in women of european heritage say researchers a team at icelands biopharmaceutical company decode genetics in reykjavic reports their finding in the online journal public library of science medicine it says the new gene called bard works in tandem with the wellknown brca and brca genes to raise the risk of breast cancer by as much as the bard variant works together with the brca mutation in iceland and increases the likelihood of breast cancer from in those who have only the brca mutation up towards in those who also have the bard variant says decode chief executive kari stefansson and women with the bard variant who develop breast cancer are more likely to have tumours in both breasts stefansson said cancer genes breast cancer is known to run in families and has a genetic component although most cases occur in people with no family history of the disease several genes are known to be involved including the brca and brca genes p and others the known brca and brca mutations only account for about of all cases of the disease the decode team is trying to find other genes that work with these genes they found women in iceland who had breast cancer and compared them to icelandic women who did not the company has a database carrying the genetic profiles of virtually everyone in iceland a certain bard mutation was found in of breast cancer patients and of women who did not have breast cancer an increase in risk the researchers say simply having the bard mutation was not especially dangerous to a woman but women who had it and a specific mutation on brca had a dramatic risk of breast cancer the researchers say adding it may be worth developing a test for that particular combination many on the research team are employees of decode genetics andor have stock or equity interests in the company mutation in italian and finnish families too this bard mutation has been found in italian and finnish families with a history of breast and ovarian cancer it has not been found in people of chinese japanese africanamerican and yoruban descent the researchers add therefore the variant may be restricted to individuals with european ancestry and could contribute to the higher load of breast cancer seen in this group they say however other bard variants have been discovered in africanamerican and japanese individuals the contribution of these variants to the risk of disease is still uncertain breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women after lung cancer affecting million women globally and killing more than every year according to the international agency for research on cancer tiny cleaner fish grooming a large client fish fish who visit mobile cleaning stations to get their parasites removed check out the cleaner fish on duty first to make sure they get the most trustworthy fish for the job dr alexandra grutter and colleagues from the university of queenslands school of integrative biology report their experiments with the great barrier reef coral reef cleaner fish labroides dimidiatus in todays issue of the journal nature a cleaner fish spends most of its day eating parasites off other client fish but cleaners are tempted to cheat at their cleaning job because they would much rather eat the sticky mucous lining that covers their clients instead of the parasites so how do client fish get cleaner fish to eat against their natural food preference and establish a cooperative cleaningfeeding service grutter says the answer lies in the fact that client fish watch cleaners while they are with other clients to see who is doing a good job to judge who to use themselves fish care about their image grutter used an aquariumbased experiment in which client fish were offered the choice of interacting with two cleaner fish one that displayed parasiteeating behaviour and one that did not given the choice between two such cleaners clients preferred to spend time close to the parasiteeating cleaner and cleaner fish were more likely to do the right thing when they were being observed by other clients than when they were alone with one client the researchers think the client fish build up a social image of the cleaners they observe and choose to allow those that score highly to feed on them grutter says cleaners learned to be more cooperative when they were having their image scored compared to when they werent these results explain why cleaner fish feed against their preference she says the finding shows that complex social networks exist in the aquatic world and helps set the stage for the evolution of altruism and reputation the researchers say landsat image of salton sea and coachella valley southern california the southern san andreas fault is shown in red the notorious san andreas fault has enough pentup energy to create a massive quake says one seismologist although he is not sure when the big one will occur professor yuri fialko of the scripps institution of oceanography at la jolla california reports his findings in todays issue of the journal nature the fault is accumulating stress at a high rate but this does not suggest that a rupture is imminent says fialko when the quake will happen nobody knows the san andreas runs northsouth along almost all of western california passing through san francisco and running just north of los angeles before emerging in the far south in the san jacinto fault the land on western side of the san andreas is heading north while the eastern side is heading south a movement called slip but slip between mighty opposing plates is a rarely a smooth affair the pentup friction when released can cause cataclysmic earthquakes but the threat can be eased if the energy is released in minor movements known as creep the northern segment of the fault produced the san francisco earthquake in and the central segment had a big quake in but the southern segment has not produced a great earthquake for at least years so the big question is when the next big one will occur there satellite images fialko looked at the critical question of creep in the southern section he used satellite imaging from two european space agency satellites and data from gps monitors deployed on the ground to get a picture of surface movement in this area from to fialko says his data is more complete than that used in previous studies because measurements were taken every metres instead of at ground stations kilometres apart sadly for the million people of the los angeles region he has only bad news to offer interestingly the study found testosterone levels did not explain the differences between male and female warmongering the first scientific proof that men who are overconfident and narcissistic are more likely to start wars has been published this week but such men are also the most likely to lose wars the study found a team led by dr dominic johnson of princeton university in new jersey report their findings online ahead of print publication in the royal society journal proceedings b they recruited men and women in an unusual experiment aimed at exploring whether a bias towards optimism may drive a leader to start a war the volunteers were asked to play a oneonone computer game each played the role of the head of a fictitious country that is in conflict with a neighbour over a vast field of diamonds on a disputed border players were each given us for taking part but earned an additional bounty of per game if they won either by amassing the most wealth or by defeating their opponent before the game each player was asked to rank himself or herself predicting how he or she would fare against the others in the game each player was given a virtual treasure chest of us million which they could spend on upgrading their military investing in industrial infrastructure or keep in reserve as cash as the game unfolded the player was given updates about his opponents actions players could negotiate deals in which they could get access to the disputed diamonds thus adding to their wealth but they also had the option of waging war at any time and without provocation victory in war would be determined by how much they had spent on their military but there was an element of chance too the computer equivalent of a roll of the dice males five times more likely to attack more than decisions were taken by the players during six rounds of the games of these involved negotiation something that could be done both during peace and during a war nbsp involved doing nothing involved fighting and to make a threat wars occurred in almost half of the games individuals who launched unprovoked attacks were more than five times likelier to be a male than female and they were big on selfconfidence too on average a warmonger ranked himself out of the players whereas those who tried to avoid war ranked themselves more humbly at on average testosterone levels contrary to popular belief though testosterone was not a key factor the players gave a saliva test before the game and these showed there was no significant difference in male hormone levels between warmongers and peaceniks on the other hand there was a clear psychological characteristic among the warmongers after the game they were given a personality assessment which found high levels of narcissism among the men but not among the women the researchers theory is that humans have a builtin bias towards optimism because it is a survival mechanism by encouraging hope called positive illusions our distant ancestors could cope with adversity strengthen their resolve and bluff their opponents but the question is when positive illusions become overconfidence and the impact that this can have in modernday society on a president or a prime minister who believes that a war despite its risks can be won quickly and easily ironically the higher the selfranking the lower the actual performance johnsons team found those who expected to do best tended to do worst the researchers say this suggests that positive illusions were not only misguided but actually may have been detrimental to performance it might be a prehistoric phenomenon but human destruction of wetlands has been faster in the last years the researchers say human damage to coastal ecology is not a recent phenomenon say an international team of scientists its been happening since the dawn of civilization whether they settled along the coasts of north america europe or australia humans have always been reducing the biodiversity of estuaries and coastal seas say researchers publishing in todays issue of the journal science this isnt a blame game says roger bradbury an adjunct professor at the australian national university and coauthor of the paper people in the th century havent started to do this weve just built on what our ancestors have done the upshot has been a depletion of more than of formerly important species destruction of more than of sea grass and wetlands and degradation of water quality the scientists say the team used detailed information from different estuary and coastal ecosystems across the globe to build a picture of what they would have looked like before humans arrived on the scene using mathematical models they created a timeline for the changes that would have taken place in the numbers of different plants and animals these models revealed that all different ecosystems would have undergone the same general trajectory of change a long period of slow decline followed by to years of rapid degeneration its just the quickening of economic growth and development says bradbury everythings quickened up the population has grown and we cycle through things faster now plus we have greater control over the world than our ancestors by depleting the living creatures in estuaries weve also had an impact on physical aspects of the ecosystems the scientists say recent disasters like the asian tsunami and last years hurricane katrina were made worse by the loss of mangroves and wetlands they say the whole thing about estuaries is that youre at the interface between sea and land bradbury says when you tamper with the living things you have an impact on physical structures on a positive note the scientists report that conservation efforts in the th century have had some impact they led to a partial recovery for of species and a substantial recovery in of species particularly for animals like seals otters birds and crocodiles things are grim in many estuaries around the world but we know enough now to turn things around bradbury says if we start now we have a reasonable chance of restoring them this isnt magic he adds its hard work the beads were made from these type of shells human culture developed slowly in northern africa and the middle east rather than bursting forth in europe suggest scientists who have discovered what may be the oldest shell beads dating back years dr francesco derrico of the national centre for scientific research in talence france and colleagues report their findings in todays issue of the journal science until recently researchers generally believed the first cultural signs emerged years ago when modern humans appeared in europe but derrico and colleagues say the new shell beads from israel and algeria were made for decorative purposes and show progress came much earlier in northern africa and the middle east modern humans in africa developed behaviours that are considered modern quite early in time says derrico these people were probably not just biologically modern but also culturally and cognitively modern jewellery and other forms of personal decoration were one of the most important early expressions of human culture says study coauthor dr marian vanhaeren of university college london searching museum collections the researchers say that searching through museum collections they found beadlike shells with holes in them from sites in skhul israel and oued djebbana algeria these were similar to shell beads dating back years found in a previous study by derrico and vanhaeren in south african caves these south african shells are now firmly believed to be decorative beads the study says to be certain the researchers say they wanted to find beads from more than one site in the same region dating to the same period to confirm that bead working was underway earlier than previously thought its very important to establish the chronology of these modern types of behavior and this paper constitutes we think a significant advancement derrico says dating the shells archaeologists excavated skhul in the early s using less meticulous methods than archaeologists use today so the researchers had to do some additional work to determine exactly where the shells came from and how old they were one of the sites sediment layers contained a series of human skeletons which recent dating efforts placed at to years old coauthor dr sarah james a researcher at the natural history museum london where the skhul specimens are kept analysed the crust of sediment stuck to one of the two shells and found that the shells came from the same sediment layer that the skeletons did the shells nassarius gibbosulus are scavenging marine snails that live in shallow waters and are now only found in the centraleastern mediterranean the relatively large size of the shells from skhul and oued djebbana also seems to confirm their old age since this species of snail was bigger years ago than it is today the researchers say oued djebbana was excavated in the late s currently just a single radiocarbon date is available indicating that the site is more than years old based on the technology and style of the stone tools found there however the site could be up to years old the researchers say the sample size is small but the researchers argue that skhul and oued djebbana are so far from the sea kilometres in case of oued djebbana that the shells must have been intentionally brought there most likely for beadworking by studying modern nassarius shells from mediterranean beaches they also determined that shells with single holes in the centre are rare in nature and that skhul and djebbana inhabitants must have purposely perforated or deliberately picked out such shells arguably for symbolic use could our perpetual childishness actually cause genetic changes grownups today are more immature than ever according to research showing that increasing numbers of adults are retaining behaviour and attitudes normally associated with youth as a consequence many older people simply never achieve mental adulthood says evolutionary psychiatrist bruce charlton from the school of biology at the university of newcastle upon tyne england among scientists the phenomenon is called psychological neoteny charlton who is also editorinchief of medical hypotheses which will feature a paper outlining his theory in an upcoming issue charlton says humans have an inherent attraction to physical youth because it can be a sign of fertility health and vitality a symptom of instability in the mid th century however another force kicked in with an increasing trend for individuals to change jobs learn new skills move to new places and make new friends a childlike flexibility of attitudes behaviours and knowledge is probably adaptive to the increased instability of the modern world charlton believes formal education now extends well past physical maturity leaving students with minds that are he says unfinished the psychological neoteny effect of formal education is an accidental byproduct the main role of education is to increase general abstract intelligence and prepare for economic activity he says but formal education requires a childlike stance of receptivity to new learning and cognitive flexibility when formal education continues into the early twenties he says it probably to an extent counteracts the attainment of psychological maturity which would otherwise occur at about this age genetic changes charlton says past cultures often marked the advent of adulthood with initiation ceremonies while the human mind responds to new information over the course of any individuals lifetime charlton argues that past physical environments were more stable and allowed for a state of psychological maturity in huntergatherer societies that maturity was probably achieved during a persons late teens or early twenties he says by contrast many modern adults fail to attain this maturity and such failure is common and indeed characteristic of highly educated and on the whole effective and socially valuable people he said people such as academics teachers scientists and many other professionals are often strikingly immature outside of their strictly specialist competence in the sense of being unpredictable unbalanced in priorities and tending to overreact charlton added that since modern cultures now favour cognitive flexibility immature people tend to thrive and succeed and have set the tone not only for contemporary life but also for the future when it is possible our genes may even change as a result of the psychological shift cultural shallowness the faults of youth are retained along with the virtues he believes these include short attention span sensation and noveltyseeking short cycles of arbitrary fashion and a sense of cultural shallowness at least youthfulness is no longer restricted to youth he says due to overall improvements in food and healthcare along with cosmetic technologies david brooks a social commentator and an oped columnist at the new york times has documented a somewhat related phenomenon concerning the current blurring of the bourgeois world of capitalism and the bohemian counterculture which charlton believes is a version of psychological neoteny a computer that can decipher your emotions could help online advertisers target you at times when youre most likey to be receptive to their message your computer may soon be able to tell what youre thinking by picking up on expressions like a raised eyebrow a nod of the head or an angry glare scientists say british and american researchers are developing an emotionally aware computer that will be able to read an individuals mind by analysing a combination of facial movements that represent feelings the technology will be unveiled at a science exhibition in london today the system we have developed allows a wide range of mental states to be identified just by pointing a video camera at someone says professor peter robinson of the university of cambridge in england he and his collaborators believe the mindreading computers applications could range from improving peoples driving skills to helping companies tailor advertising to peoples moods imagine a computer that could pick the right emotional moment to try to sell you something a future where mobile phones cars and web sites could read our mind and react to our moods he says the technology is already programmed to recognise different facial expressions generated by actors robinson hopes to get more data to determine whether someone is bored interested confused or agrees or disagrees visitors to the fourday exhibition organised by the royal society britains academy of leading scientists will be invited to take part in a study to hone the programs abilities encoding boredom tiredness confusion the scientists who are developing the technology in collaboration with researchers at the massachusetts institute of technology mit in the united states also hope to get it to accept other inputs such as posture and gesture our research could enable web sites to tailor advertising or products to your mood robinson says for example a webcam linked with our software could process your image encode the correct emotional state and transmit information to a web site it could also be useful in online teaching to show whether someone understands what is being explained and in improving road safety by determining if a driver is confused bored or tired we are working with a big car company and they envision this being employed in cars within five years robinson says adding that a camera could be built into the dashboard anyone who doesnt want to give away too much information about what they are feeling can just cover up the camera he says lava flows from a super eruption half a billion years ago in australia covered hundreds of thousands of square kilometres scattered rafts of black lava over northern and central australia are really part of one gigantic volcanic field that appears to be one of oldest and largest on earth geologists believe if so the half billion year old eruption might be the culprit in the first mass animal extinction event in the history of life australian geologists used the chemical signatures of the farflung basalt lava rocks and their ages to connect them to a single huge volcanic eruptive episode between and million years ago the newly identified kalkarindji continental flood basalt province covered at least square kilometres with more than cubic kilometres of lava report geologists dr linda glass and dr david phillips who were at the australian national university when the research was undertaken bigger than thought it may be a lot larger than we think phillips says he says since the paper appeared this month in the journal geology hes been getting calls from other australian geologists who say they know of even more distant pieces of what could be the same mega lava deposit unlike episodic and hacking explosive volcanoes like mount st helens or mount pinatubo flood basalts literally pour lava out onto the earths surface in often vastly greater quantities and over far longer periods perhaps many hundreds of thousands of years according to some geologists that means they can cover a lot more ground younger recent flood basalts can be found mostly intact in places like the columbia river region of the us pacific northwest but at a halfbillion years old the kalkarindji continental flood basalts have been heavily eroded and buried leaving only farflung hints of its former glory this is part of a growing picture says paul renne director of the berkeley geochronology center in california other large volcanic provinces have been identified in the same way first in one area by a few geologists then with a flurry of discoveries by other geologists who were working on other parts of the puzzle but hadnt seen the larger context link to cambrian mass extinction two things make the kalkarindji continental flood basalt province discovery special and robust says renne one is that its the oldest such lava formation dated using the very reliable argonargon analysis and phillips is one of the worlds top argonargon researchers renne says but renne adds that chemical aging of the farflung rocks makes the process of dating them slightly less reliable the second thing is that the timing of kalkarindji is right at the first major dieoff of animals after they first exploded onto the scene about million years ago during the lower cambrian period that time span was when animal life on earth really took off says phillips we have the mass proliferation of species things just took off like wildfire agrees renne then at somewhere around million years ago many of the strange new beasts were mysteriously wiped out a massive release of lava could have caused such an event by releasing a lot of heat and climate changing gases into the atmosphere practitioners of feng shui say it can improve your living and working environmment but does it also work for web pages chinese feng shui and the ancient indian science of vaastu shastra can boost business by helping web designers create better pages say experts who are marrying traditional philosophies with the internet believers in vaastu shastra say the system seeks to create harmony between people objects and the five elements of earth fire water air and space they say it can be directly applied to the web just as it is to home design the philosophy of feng shui has also been used for centuries to bring balance and harmony between people and their environment just as the world comprises of the five basic elements each web site has five elements and these need to be in balance with one another says dr smita narang author of web vaastu the book has proved popular with businesses how it works earth is the layout fire is the colour air is the html space is name of the web site and water is the font and graphics says narang he says each must be chosen carefully to strike a balance with the other narang a vaastu expert who has spent four years analysing around sites says a web site that disregards vaastu rules will have few hits and business will suffer an essential element of feng shui is the idea that unnecessary objects allow free flow of energy followers say they say this principle can also be applied to making better websites and generating more visits a web site where the colours hurt your eyes the music offends your ears or has too much information is probably too cluttered and does not give a positive flow of chi says vikram narayan a mumbaibased feng shui practitioner the trick narayan says is to remove items on your web site that serve no purpose and keep the things that serve you well brijesh agarwal of indiamart a company offering business solutions to small and mediumsized enterprises says he has had mixed results on the five sites that his company has designed according to vaastu principles we have found that on three sites the number of hits has increased by nbsp but the other two sites have not been affected agarwal says i cant say for definite that the positive results are due to vaastu or due to increased marketing but i hope that vaastu has helped the conditions that determine whether a male will grow up gay may be present before birth research suggests the last male child in a family of many boys is more likely to be gay than a boy who is born first or has fewer brothers according to new research the canadian study published in the us proceedings of the national academy of sciences online journal suggests that being gay starts in the womb the study led by dr anthony bogaert of brock university near toronto found that having older brothers increases a mans chance of being gay even if the older brothers dont live with the younger sibling adopted or step brothers dont appear to have an effect the most consistent biodemographic correlate of sexual orientation in men is the number of older brothers one has and not social influences bogaert reports only biological older brothers and not any other sibling characteristic including nonbiological older brothers predicted mens sexual orientation regardless of the amount of time reared with these siblings theres no evidence that similar patterns apply to girls he says fraternal birth order effect the results are a variation of the socalled fraternal birth order effect theory on homosexuality in men the researchers didnt investigate the mechanism at play but bogaert says his study indicates that biological rather than social or childrearing factors are at play one possible explanation is that during pregnancy a mothers immune system recognises male foetuses as foreign and creates maternal antimale antibodies these antibodies could affect the part of the brain that determines sexuality the effect is cumulative and therefore more likely to cause homosexuality in the last of several sons born to the same mother these results support a prenatal origin to sexual orientation development in men and indicate that the fraternal birth order effect is probably the result of a maternal memory for male gestations or births he says female foetuses arent affected because mothers are themselves female so the mother doesnt create antibodies against daughters bogaert reports that the age of the mother also appears related to the sexual orientation of her sons with homosexual mens mothers being significantly younger than the mothers of heterosexual men gay staircase effect professor roger short a reproductive biologist in the faculty of medicine at melbourne university says there could be a social element in younger brothers with lots of older male siblings becoming gay i wouldnt be surprised if you come from a large unisex family where youre one boy amongst many and the last in the line that youve got a slightly socially deprived environment he says that could make you more aligned with the same sex because youd be so ignorant and terrified about the opposite sex but he says while having a female sandwiched between two males in utero can have a masculising influence in species like rats and mice theres no biological evidence for bogaerts theory of maternal antigens producing gay boys no ones ever suggested that maternal antibodies to something produced by a male foetus could have a long lasting effect to act on subsequent male foetuses he says so each subsequent male foetus would be a little more gay than the one before it you would have a sort of gay staircase effect new technology aims to convert footsteps into renewable energy vibrations from passing trucks the rumbling of speeding trains and even the footfall of busy city commuters could be captured and converted into energy to light walkways and buildings engineers say a londonbased architectural firm is working on a project that aims to harness the pulse of a city and use it as a renewable energy source facility architects director clair price says tens of thousands of people can pass through urban hubs like train stations during rush hour you dont need to be a maths genius to realise that if you can harness that energy you can actually generate a very useful power source that is currently being wasted she says prices team has financial and technical support from several organisations for the proposal my first reaction when i saw it was wow this is fantastic says tony bates business development manager at scott wilson an engineering consultancy firm based in the uk as an engineer of course you can really see that this can really work bates and price are now in the process of developing a joint partnership to make the idea a reality the architectural team is working with university research groups to finish two vibrationharvesting prototypes by december good vibrations the first is a staircase that will contain hydraulic or piezoelectric technology in the risers the technology will pick up kinetic energy from commuter footfalls and convert it into an electrical current climbing stairs requires more force which means theres more energy to be tapped engineering experts from the university of hull hope to develop a system that will convert at least of the six to eight watts each person typically generates while walking the current will be stored in a battery which can be used to provide energy for lighting or electronic devices the second prototype is a wireless lighting system that will use tiny generators with components designed to resonate at the same frequency as surrounding vibrations the resonance will either move a magnet relative to a coil or put stress on a crystalline structure inside a generator to produce a current lightemitting diodes connected to such vibration harvesters could illuminate the underside of arches the double vortex at venus south pole venus has a bizarre double vortex that whirls in the atmosphere above its south pole a new mission to the planet has found the unmanned venus express spacecraft spotted the double eye formed by winds of superhurricane force in its very first swing around venus says the european space agency esa the venus express pictures also show the presence of a collar of cold air around the vortex structure possibly due to the recycling of cold air downwards previous missions to venus have spotted a similar structure over the planets north pole and glimpsed at stormy atmospheric behaviour at the south pole the winds on venus spin westwards at hundreds of kilometres per hour taking only four days to complete the rotation of a planet that is just under the size of earth this superrotation combined with the natural recycling of hot air in the atmosphere would logically induce a vortex over each pole but the mystery is why there should be two vortices we still know very little about the mechanisms by which the superrotation and the polar vortexes are linked says dr haringkan svedhem the missions project scientist also we are still not able to explain why the global atmospheric circulation of the planet results in a double vortex and not a single vortex he says atmospheric vortextes are very complex structures that are very difficult to model even on earth venus express is europes first dedicated mission to earths closest planet it went into elongated orbit around venus on april equipped with scanners aimed at deciphering the enigmatic venusian atmosphere the elongated orbit lasted days and ranged between and kilometres from venus surface since may venus express has been circling the planet in its final hour orbit ranging between and kilometres from venus the planet seems to have a case of runaway global warming and understanding the mechanisms that drive this could be of use in dealing with climate change on earth venuss mean surface temperature is ordmc hot enough to melt lead and even hotter than mercury the closest planet to the sun its atmosphere is carbon dioxide with yellowish clouds of sulfur and sulfuric acid droplets a new tool for world peace video games can help save the world by raising awareness of the worlds downtrodden a group of socially conscious game designers say the creators of free educational games such as darfur is dying and peacemaker met with humanitarian activists at the new school university in new york this week for the third games for change annual conference the idea is to use video games to educate youth about realworld issues fighting poverty surviving in wartorn sudan and negotiating middle east peace and while there is violence in the games it is being perpetrated by reallife players such as warring countries not by the person playing the game its the next generation of activism says stephen friedman general manager of mtvu a television network owned by cable channel mtv aimed at college students that created a grant program encouraging educational games given this generation lives online its heartening to see them using this incredibly powerful medium in a very potent way friedman says gaining popularity the idea appears to be gaining popularity darfur is dying which allows players to avoid being killed in violenceplagued sudan was downloaded more than times in the past two months food force created by the world food programme at the united nations has been downloaded off the internet more than million times just developers and activists attended the first games for change conference in about people participated this year large gaming companies have expressed some interest in the markets potential bob kerrey the president of the new school and a former us senator from nebraska says i do see some glimmers of reason to be optimistic that games can be used to accomplish educational missions and improve peoples quality of understanding of whats going on in the world kerrey says the question for us is how do i use it to accomplish something good in the shoes of a refugee darfur is dying puts players in the shoes of a sudanese refugee plunked down in the middle of the violence players must make it to a water well and try to survive for seven days in a camp besieged by militia in peacemaker players take the role of either the israeli prime minister or the palestinian president and try their hand at situations ranging from diplomatic talks to responding to military attacks peacemaker cocreator eric brown says he hopes to usher video games into a new socially conscious arena we believe in the power of interactive media and we think it has a lot of positive potential says brown a carnegie mellon university graduate student just by putting someone in the shoes of the other side they may think of a perspective they might not have thought of before the feeling of being watched make us do the right thing researchers have found forget about installing closedcircuit surveillance cameras a simple lowcost defence against thieves and freeloaders may be a photocopy of a pair of eyes behaviour researchers at the newcastle university in the uk conducted a sly experiment on their colleagues and found that people were encouraged do the right thing when they were being watched by a pair of eyes on a poster the study by dr melissa bateson and team is believed to be the first to test how cues of being watched affect peoples tendency for social cooperation in a reallife setting the study is reported online ahead of print publication in the royal societys journal biology letters honesty box for their experiment bateson and her colleagues made use of a longrunning honesty box arrangement in a common room used by around staff in the universitys psychology department academics were asked to put money in the box for any tea coffee and milk they used without anyone checking to see whether they were actually doing so the honesty box had been operating for many years so users had no reason to suspect an experiment was taking place over weeks the researchers placed a poster above the honesty box listing prices of tea coffee and milk the poster also featured an image banner across the top that alternated each week between different pictures of flowers and eyes the eye pictures varied in the sex and head orientation but were all chosen so that the eyes were looking directly at the observer each week the research team recorded the total amount of money collected and the volume of milk consumed as this was considered to be the best index available of total drink consumption the team then calculated the ratio of money collected to the volume of milk consumed in each week the eyes have it on weeks when the eyes image was shown takings were higher than during the flower weeks i was really surprised by how big the effect was as we were expecting it to be quite subtle but the statistics show that the eyes had a strong effect on our tea and coffee drinkers says bateson the researchers say the study suggests that humans are strongly attuned to subconscious cues about behaviour that could damage their reputation our brains are programmed to respond to eyes and faces whether we are consciously aware of it or not says bateson the researchers say that being seen to cooperate is a good longterm strategy for individuals because it is likely to mean others will return the gesture when needed our findings suggest that people are less likely to be selfish if they feel they are being watched which has huge implications for real life says bateson for example this could be applied to warnings about speed cameras a sign bearing an image of a camera would have to be actively processed by our brains as it is an artificial stimulus our research and previous studies suggest drivers would react much more quickly and positively to natural stimuli such as eyes and faces the group now hopes to expand the study to involve a larger sample population as oil reserves dwindle it is being suggested we could use underground explosions to increase the permeability of rocks and make it easier to extract the remaining oil creating artificial seismic waves similar to those that occur during an earthquake could help squeeze more oil from natural reservoirs say scientists dr emily brodsky of university of california santa cruz and colleagues report their findings in todays issue of the journal nature shaking increases permeability says brodsky an assistant professor of earth sciences permeability governs how fluid flows through rock whether its water or oil so this has practical implications for oil extraction she says brodsky and colleagues also found that the amount of permeability is directly related to the amplitude of the shaking potentially if you could increase permeability you could greatly increase the available oil you could tap out of a reserve she says one way of doing that in principle is by mimicking the effects of an earthquake using for example underground explosions if we understood the physics of the permeability enhancement well enough the vibrations could be tuned to increase with the flow of oil brodsky says clues from water seepage the scientists made their discovery after studying years of data of water seeping in and out of wells during seven earthquakes in an area of california they found that water levels in the wells rose and fell gradually according to local weather and rainfall but superimposed on these longterm trends were regular daily variations of a few centimetres owing to the solid earth tides as the motion of the moon around the earth makes local sea levels rise and fall tidally each day so this and the earths rotation causes tidal squeezing of the solid earth the effect is tiny but it squeezes the porous rock of the aquifer that feeds the wells pressurising the water held in the pores and forcing regular changes of up to centimetres in the well water as the squeezing subsides well water flows back into the aquifer but how quickly this happens depends on the permeability of the rock the team noticed that every time an earthquake occurred the permeability jumped and the surrounding rocks became up to three times more permeable a few months after the tremor the rocks relaxed back into its original state and permeability returned to normal levels the scientists are planning more studies to better understand what aspects of the shaking makes the permeability increase they are also interested in studying how seismically induced changes in fluid flow within geological faults might trigger further earthquakes nasa says another major incident in launching the space shuttle would cast doubts on the program nasa is ready for a second and likely last attempt to recover from the columbia disaster and resume construction of the halfbuilt international space station after more than three years and us billion since the columbia accident the countdown has begun for the launch of the space shuttle discovery at am sunday australian eastern standard time everyones been excited and kind of anxious to get into a launch countdown nasa test director jeff spaulding said at a press conference this week theyve worked hard to get us to this point nasas chief says its time to move despite objections from key safety and engineering officials who unsuccessfully argued for additional modifications before discovery flies nasa administrator mike griffin acknowledges he is taking a chance but not with the lives of the astronauts who could stay aboard the station for nearly three months while they wait for a new ride home if discovery should suffer columbialike damage during its liftoff in columbia was struck by a chunk of foam weighing nearly a kilogram that fell off its external fuel tank and smashed into its left wing the damage was undetected until after the shuttle broke apart as it flew through the atmosphere for landing days later all seven astronauts aboard died some foam loss still expected last year nasa flew its first mission since the accident testing not only a new tank design but also a myriad of inflight inspection techniques heat shield repair materials and other safety improvements large pieces of foam insulation again fell off the tank and the fleet was grounded again nasa still expects some foam loss particularly from areas that cover metal brackets holding pressurisation lines and a box of cables to the outside of the tank but any flyaway foam is expected to be too small to do damage shuttle managers said with the fleets retirement date looming and plans to build a new vehicle to transport crews and cargo to the station and eventually the moon nasa has neither the time nor money to handle more serious shuttle problems if we have another major incident in launching the space shuttle i would not wish to continue with the program griffin said equipment and supplies launching will be only the beginning the shuttle is scheduled to dock at the space station two days later to deliver more than kilograms of equipment and supplies as well as a new crewmember european astronaut thomas reiter the station has been operating with just twoman crews since columbias demise to save on supplies while the shuttle which delivers the bulk of the stations cargo was grounded the most critical equipment includes replacement parts for the stations mobile transporter which was shut down after it inadvertently severed a set of cables that provide power video and data without the transporter which is a small cart that runs along tracks on the outside the station to move equipment to various work sites station assembly cannot continue one of up to three spacewalks planned during the flight is devoted to repairing the transporter astronauts piers sellers and michael fossum are also scheduled to test an extension to the shuttles metrelong robotic arm to see if it is stable enough to serve as a work platform for emergency inflight heat shield repairs on currently inaccessible parts of the shuttle the study showed children who stuttered showed greater emotional reactivity to everyday stresses like having a toy taken away preschoolers who stutter may have more difficulty controlling their emotions than other children their age a study has found suggesting that emotional factors contribute to the speech disorder dr edward conture a us professor of hearing and speech sciences at vanderbilt university in nashville and colleagues will report their findings in the journal of communication disorders stuttering is a common speech problem that typically becomes apparent between the ages of and years old children may repeat or draw out words or parts of words or have difficulty beginning a word the exact cause of stuttering is unknown but it probably involves a complex interaction between genes and environment says conture stuttering is believed to have a strong genetic component as it often runs in families but it has also long been suspected that emotional development may contribute to the disorder says conture his team found that preschoolers who stuttered were typically more excitable than their peers with normal speech and tended to have a harder time calming down or shifting their attention away from a stressful situation the findings are based on reports from parents of preschoolers who stuttered and children who did not both groups of parents completed a standardised questionnaire on child behaviour three general differences between the two groups emerged conture says children who stuttered showed greater emotional reactivity to everyday stresses like having a toy taken away it took them longer to settle down once they were excited or upset and they were less adept at shifting their attention away from the stressor often becoming fixated on it instead the researchers suspect that poor attentional control leading to higher levels of emotional reactivity may contribute to the development of stuttering in children who are predisposed to the speech problem findings support parents observations conture says the findings are in line with what parents often tell their childs doctor or speech therapist that emotional outbursts or excitement seem to trigger stuttering episodes he says parents should tell their health care provider if they notice that their child regularly has strong emotional reactions to everyday challenges or changes in their daily routine parents may be able to help their child by demonstrating ways to calmly cope with stressful situations says conture he also notes that children can have difficulty controlling not only negative emotions but excitement over positive events as well so it may not be a good idea he said to tell your child about a trip to somewhere exciting months beforehand no one knows yet whether helping children better regulate their emotions will aid their stuttering problems but conture says the current findings tell us this is something we should look at he also emphasises that parents should not feel guilty about any role emotional control might play in stuttering there is no evidence that parents cause their children to stutter conture says only of people surveyed felt comfortable with gm plants for food and only felt comfortable with gm animals for food australians are becoming more comfortable with new technologies like stem cell research but still have strong reservations about genetically modified foods a new survey shows the survey conducted by the australian centre for emerging technologies and society at swinburne university in melbourne asked more than people about their views on emerging technologies overall australians are optimistic about science and technology says professor michael gilding director of the centre that conducted the survey the swinburne national technology and science monitor the poll has been conducted each year since and the latest results were gathered in the interesting thing about the last three years is that people seem to be becoming more comfortable with the technologies that weve been monitoring gilding says on the subject of stem cell research australians seem to be more comfortable compared to the survey shows research conducted in public institutes garnered a higher approval rating and men tended to be more comfortable than women with the research but when the respondents were asked about genetically modified crops or animals their reaction was decidedly more negative that was the standout from our point of view gilding says overall people are still very uncomfortable with those technologies only said they were comfortable with gm plants for food the researchers found when respondents were asked to rate their comfort level with gm crops they gave an average score of on a scale where zero was not at all comfortable and represented very comfortable the survey also found that just of people were comfortable with genetically modifying animals for food giving an average score of out of a possible in the end people are probably weighing the perceived risks of gm foods against their benefits gilding suggests i suppose the bottom line is that they dont see any benefit for themselves craig cormick manager of public awareness for the governments biotechnology australia says that broad questions about attitudes to gm food can miss subtleties in the way people think about the issue for example individuals will view the risks and benefits of gm foods differently depending on the food he says attitudes to gm wheat will be different to doughnuts with gm soy in them in other findings the survey showed that of people agreed that science and technology are continuously improving our quality of life this figure has been consistently high since the first survey in respondents also said they most strongly trusted science information they get from the csiro universities hospitals and scientists in general they did not trust the media the fertilising effect of rising co on crops like wheat could be only half as much as previously thought increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide may be less of a boon to crop agriculture than previously thought according to a new study plant biologist dr andrew leakey of the university of illinois at urbanchampaign and colleagues report their findings in todays issue of the journal science to date ipcc scientists and others have said increased photosynthesis due to higher carbon dioxide levels could offset crop losses brought about by higher temperatures and lower soil moisture in a warmer global climate but leakey and colleagues predict the fertilising effect of rising co will be only half as much as has been thought by what were saying is the fertilisation effect of co will not be as good a thing as was previously thought says leakey the current predictions are overoptimistic the researchers say the ipccs data come from old experiments on crops grown in greenhouses and shelters that dont properly capture real field conditions studies using special field experiments show the actual benefit from rising co to world staples such as corn rice sorghum soybeans and wheat they say the field experiments involve freeair concentration enrichment technology experiments in which crops are grown in a standard field but are surrounded by special contraptions that allow co to be released across them to simulate increasing atmospheric concentrations its very much more real world says leakey he says unlike in glasshouse experiments the plants receive natural light wind temperature rainfall and have as much root volume as they need the field experiments also allow for pests and diseases that are part of real world conditions when you do these experiments in the field under realistic simulations of future conditions we see about of the response to increasing co that was previously seen says leakey leakey says the results are averaged from a number of field experiments involving different crops in the us switzerland new zealand and japan he says good data is not available for the tropics and more research on this and on other areas such as wheat production in australia is needed there also needs to be more field experiments to study the impact of changing ozone temperature and drought on agriculture says leakey he also says it may be possible to breed crops that are better able to make use of increasing co levels an unusual antarctic sea spider with five pairs of legs its large proboscis is protruding towards the bottom of the picture weird spiderlike creatures that live at the bottom of the ocean and use a straw to suck on their prey are baffling scientists these sea spiders some of which are blind are defying scientific classification marine zoologist dr claudia arango of the australian museum in sydney agrees they are arthropods but which type she presented her research on these unusual and poorly understood animals recently at the scientific committee on antarctic research meeting in hobart they are very weird looking animals says arango for over years scientists have been puzzling over how exactly to classify sea spiders or pycnogonids they crawl along the bottom of the sea floor sometimes more than to metres down where they live in the dark feeding on slowmoving softbodied sponges and sea slugs the creatures are segmented and have an exoskeleton which makes them an arthropod the same grouping as crustaceans insects centipedes and spiders but they also have a very strange collection of features including a unique feeding structure they have a proboscis thats like a straw that they insert into the animals and suck out the juices says arango such features make it difficult to fit them into any of the known groups of arthropods they look like spiders but they are not real spiders says arango its been very hard to place them in a position within the tree of life arango has been studying the diversity and evolution of sea spiders she has been using dna and morphology to construct a family tree using species of sea spiders from all over the world discovery poised for launch bad weather has forced the us space agency to postpone the launch of the space shuttle discovery the next launch is set for wednesday australian eastern standard time tuesday utc the decision by nasa to cancel liftoff came minutes after the seven crew members boarded the spaceship even before the vessels hatch was closed hours before nasa forecasters estimated there was only a nbsp chance that weather conditions would favour a launch as thunderclouds menaced the kennedy space center weve concluded that were not going to have a chance to launch today launch director mike leinbach told the crew as they sat strapped into their shuttle seats ok we copy said shuttle commander steve lindsey looking out the window it doesnt look good today and we think thats a great plan too many risks the mission management teams chairman john shannon confirmed bad weather had prevented the launch we had the vehicle ready to go the crew ready to go and its just that one thing that we really dont control the weather that kept us from launching he told reporters any rain during liftoff might damage the spaceships heatshielding tiles and a lightning strike could knock out the computers that control the ship even thick high clouds can make a launch hazardous discoverys mission is only the second since the columbia accident and another disaster or serious problem could end the shuttle program nasa is hoping to fly more missions to complete the a billion us billion space station before the shuttle fleet is retired in debates over safety shuttle safety has been at the forefront of the program since columbia disintegrated on reentry in killing seven astronauts nasa has twice redesigned the shuttles fuel tank which shed insulating foam that triggered the accident the agencys top engineer and chief of safety wanted more repairs on the tank before discovery was launched but nasa administrator michael griffin overruled them arguing that if foam falls again from the fuel tank and damages the shuttle the crew could stay aboard the space station and await rescue griffin says the debate over safety is a good thing nasa had been criticised in the past for adhering to groupthink for enforcing a needless conformity in decisionmaking he said on cnns late edition we have difficult technically complex and subtle decisions to make we did the best analysis we can and we make a decision and im comfortable with that delaying the launch would put more pressure on the shuttles which are the only vehicles that can deliver and install the stations remaining trusses solar arrays and laboratories the agency plans two more flights this year and about four a year until the station is finished and the fleet is retired nasa had hoped to resume space station construction last year but the shuttles fuel tank failed its first test flight engineers then removed two long wind deflectors from the tank which had shed foam during discoverys liftoff we have the technology to clone animals and even humans but what have we gained ten years after the first sheep was cloned from an adult cell this wednesday marks ten years since a lamb named dolly born in scotland made international headlines as the globes first cloned mammal she also triggered a storm of dreams dread and ethical polemic that hasnt abated since a river of money and hope directed into the quest for cures for cancer heart degeneration alzheimers and other crippling disease has also flowed from the event but there has been anguished debate bitter opposition and the crafting of laws and guidelines to restrict or shape cloning research in australia a legislative review by former federal court judge john lockhart last year recommended lawmakers lift the current ban on therapeutic cloning however a number of government ministers oppose the recommendation and prime minister john howard has promised a party room debate in august before a decision is made questions have also been raised about what exactly scientists have achieved with the creation of dolly where has dolly taken us asks sue mayer a doctor who is a member of genewatch uk a british watchdog that monitors biotechnology the biggest worry is that she has taken us down a blind alley rather than tackling the root causes of disease we are going for hype and quick fixes which may never deliver and shes opened this prospect of reproductive cloning a door which scientists try to keep open but which we should firmly close somatic cell nuclear transfer the technique that led to dolly is called somatic cell nuclear transfer and has remained essentially unchanged over the decade a mammalian egg is taken and its nucleus the dna program for making life is removed the nucleus is replaced through a microscopic glass tube by the nucleus of a cell from the animal to be cloned the reconstructed egg is then treated with a jolt of electricity and placed in a dish of nurturing chemicals to make it divide a few days later it becomes a cluster of cells big enough to be transplanted into the surrogate mothers uterus dolly created at the roslin institute in edinburgh was named after dolly parton the bigbusted country and western singer because the cell that was cloned came from a sheeps mammary gland her lab name rather less mediafriendly was ll it later emerged that the same team managed by ian wilmut had previously created two sheep clones from embryonic cells so strictly speaking dolly was the first mammal to be successfully cloned from an adult cell not all good news after this breakthrough other cloned species swiftly followed horses bulls pigs mice rats rabbits cats and dogs and others but the miscarriage rate of transplanted eggs is extremely high and of those embryos that make it to term many have deformities or as happened with dolly die prematurely a clear warning to any scientist mad or foolish enough to try to make a cloned baby the suspected cause is that the genetic software isnt transferred entirely or is somehow damaged in the transfer as a result the machinery malfunctions genes dont switch on or off as they should in the complex ballet of making proteins so if cloning is frustrating costly and potentially risky why bother with it the most alluring reason is medical a cloned lab animal such as a mouse can provide a very useful standardised tool for experiment and a farm animal that can be engineered and cloned to produce rare pharmaceutical proteins in its milk dolly was created with this in mind could help save lives and ease suffering embryonic stem cells and ethical firestorms but the most glittering prize of all is to harness cloning to embryonic stem cells the primitive master cells of earlystage embryos that famously have the power to develop into almost any tissue of the body researchers believe embryonic stem cells can some day be coaxed into regenerative tissue that could repair brain cells nerves kidneys livers and other organs damaged by disease so if these stemcells are copies of the patients own dna they would not be rejected by the immune system but here comes the ethical firestorm some religious groups already oppose the use of human embryonic cells saying that this tissue has the same value as a life yet there is an added queasiness about human cloning that is shared by many others even if the immediate goal is therapeutic and nothing is created beyond a tiny cluster of cells a further step will have been taken towards baby cloning at the moment patientspecific embryonic stem cells remain beyond the horizon the only scientist to have claimed to have made them south koreas hwang woosuk was unmasked in january as a fraud as for reproductive cloning many countries introduced laws after a renegade sect the raelians claimed in late to have produced the worlds first cloned baby that claim has never been independently confirmed or even examined and most scientists scoff at it that said many also predict that the first cloned human is only a matter of time the reproductive cloning laws that are in place are pretty wellestablished throughout the world but there are also laws in place against murder and suicide says james bradley a professor of cell and developmental biology at auburn university in alabama plants like corn could be a green source of plastics using a new technology to turn starch into other products scientists have come up with a way to produce a chemical from fruit sugar that they say is remarkably similar to one that comes from petroleum the method reported by professor james dumesic of the university wisconsin madison could put plants such as corn on par with petroleum reducing our dependency on petroleum products and creating more environmentally friendly ones the nice thing about using biomass as a replacement for all these petroleum products is that it is greenhouse neutral saysyuriy romanleshkov who with dumesic and colleagues reported their findings in the current issue of science when a plantbased product eventually decomposes or is burned as in the case with fuel it doesnt introduce additional carbon dioxide into the atmosphere the way petroleum products do he says nice idea but hows it done its a great idea but finding an efficient costeffective way to turn the starch into other products is difficult molecules that come from petroleum are easy to work with and can be strung together in different combinations to produce everything from the polyester of a leisure suit to the polypropylene of a fleece jacket to the polyethylene terephthalate of a two litre bottle of soft drink petroleum molecules are also cost efficient almost all the petrochemical that goes into making a product ends up in the product so there is very little waste not so easy with biological molecules but doing the same thing with biological molecules is not so easy biological molecules tend to be much more complex so because of that doing specific chemistry to make a specific molecule is more challenging says brent shanks associate professor of chemical and biological engineering at iowa state university you are going to have to develop new processing paradigms says shanks who isnt a member of the research team dumesic and his colleagues think they have developed a new paradigm first they dissolve sugar and water and then add a catalyst to the mix next they mix in an organic solvent and heat it to degc the process causes the sugar to lose three water molecules which blend in with the rest of the water the leftover substance becomes the chemical hydroxymethylfurfural or hmf hmf looks and behaves a lot like a petroleumbased molecule and could be strung together in different combinations to produce plastics and fuels the challenge says shanks will be to get industry to adopt hmf although it functions similarly to petroleumbased chemicals its still slightly different can the industry reconfigure to handle those slightly different properties he asked at the end of the day its all about cost scientists may have underestimated how long it takes for cfcs to reach antarcticas stratosphere and how long they stay there despite widespread international reductions in ozone destroying chemicals the antarctic ozone hole will probably continue its annual appearance for another years say atmospheric scientists years longer than previous estimates a new model that analyses the effects of ozone gobbling chlorofluorocarbon cfc emissions predicts a return to pre stratospheric ozone levels over the southern continent in whats more no meaningful shrinking of the ozone hole should be expected before say us researchers from nasa national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa and the national center for atmospheric research in a recent issue of geophysical research letters the previous models underestimated the amount of chlorine and bromine over antarctica says nasa atmospheric scientist dr paul newman referring to the two elements that tear ozone apart thats why we underestimated the recovery rate one reason for earlier miscalculation is that cfc quantities over antarctica were originally measured indirectly by how much ozone destruction they caused but when far more chlorine and bromine is present than needed to destroy all the ozone over antarctica its difficult to predict the consequence of such a surplus saturated with chlorine in the s the stratosphere over antarctica saw the first of this sort of saturation effect says newman with ozone destruction and plenty of chlorine and bromine to spare there can be no significant change in ozone destruction until the levels of harmful chemicals at least drop below the saturation level the new model estimates that will happen by with a detectable reduction in ozone destruction by now we understand how the models were wrong newman says another change to the model comes from new information on how long it takes chlorinecontaining cfcs to reach the antarctic stratosphere and how long they linger says atmospheric researcher dr john austin of noaas geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory and the uks met office over the last few years weve realised that it takes a lot longer for the chlorofluorocarbons to be taken out of the atmosphere says austin the longer they linger the slower the ozone recovers yet another concern that has been raised in recent months is that the amounts of cfcs still being emitted hasnt dropped off as quickly as expected that could possibly add more delays to ozone recovery at both poles in principle you could have another delay of another couple of decades says austin you keep adding more and more delays and youre starting to look at another years thats a problem these dodo bones found recently on the island of mauritius tell a different story of how these birds became extinct scientists who unearthed a mass dodo grave in mauritius say they have found evidence showing a natural disaster killed the birds long before humans arrived on the indian ocean island most theories about how the dodo became extinct blame early settlers who found the plump flightless bird in the th century and hunted it relentlessly now researchers say there may have been additional reasons for the dodos demise there are indications that the fossilrich layer represents the result of natural disaster wiping out a significant part of the dodoecotope the researchers say while the latest find does not disprove the human theory the scientists are convinced there was a mass dodo death possibly caused by a cyclone or flood predating the arrival of humans says christian foo kune of the sugar estate where the remains were found the fact that there are such a wide range of animals there small and big ones suggests that there was a sudden natural disaster he says the mass grave also shows no domestic animals so it is prior to the arrival of man the bones were thought to be at least years old he adds we could be talking about a cyclone or repeated cyclones flooding or a sudden rise in sea water levels that trapped the animals there he says the scientists from the dodo research programme last month recovered a wealth of dodo remains and fossils of other animals and plants including nowextinct mauritian giant tortoises parrots and tree seeds from a sugar estate in the southeast researchers on the project say the fossils should enable them to reconstruct the dodos world in the years before humans found the bird and determine what caused it to die out foo kune says that as the deaths at his site occurred before the final extinction of the dodo more than two centuries later the scientists believe it does not rule out the idea that bird became extinct by human causes portuguese sailors first visited mauritius in the th century and dutch settlers colonised it the following century which is when the dodo died out unused to predators the dodos were not frightened of the human settlers who hunted it and destroyed the forests that provided its habitat passing ships also brought rats which ate the birds eggs located in nests on the ground details of the worlds first partial face transplant have been published online in the lancet journal but ethical issues remain the worlds first partial face transplant carried out by french doctors last november has been acclaimed by the medical establishment as a historic achievement although major risks remain unresolved controversy had swirled around the pioneering operation carried out by a team led by professor bernard devauchelle in amiens northern france with critics suggesting it was fraught with surgical and psychological peril but in a sign that the exploit has been accepted by the core of the medical community devauchelle provides a detailed account of the transplant procedure in the prestigious peerreviewed journal the lancet he also says that the patients state at the fourmonth mark was fine the technical feasibility of the procedure has been clearly demonstrated with no surgical complication says devauchelle whose paper is published online the functional result will be assessed in the future but this graft can already be deemed successful with respect to appearance sensitivity and acceptance by the patient the patient isabelle dinoire lost her nose lips and right cheek after she was savaged by a dog on november a triangularshaped part of the face of a yearold woman who was declared brain dead after suffering a severe stroke was grafted on to dinoires face thinking of rejection microsurgery was used to suture arteries veins and motor nerves and dinoire was given immunosuppressant drugs aimed at thwarting rejecting of the transplanted organ she was also given two grafts of bone marrow four days and days after the transplant to help produce white blood cells to fight off infection a frequent consequence of taking immunosuppressors bonemarrow transplants are themselves risky sometimes causing lifethreatening complications one of the surgeons who took part was professor jeanmichel dubernard who carried out the worlds handforearm transplant two analyses of the operation also published online by the lancet pay tribute to devauchelles work but they also raise questions over the longer term german facial surgeon dr patrick warnke of the university of kiel hailed the operation as a new milestone but he warned failure of the immunosuppressant regimen chosen could prove devastating with the possible loss of the transplanted face at any time in addition heavy use of these drugs also boosts the risk of cancer meaning that a woman who before the operation was otherwise healthy despite her major handicap is now at great risk he says the ethics of transplants dr edgardo carosella of the st louis hospital in paris and thomas pradeu of sorbonne university says the ethical dilemma of a face transplant remain unresolved in the case of the first hand transplant the recipient new zealander clint hallam began to view the organ as alien stopped taking immunosuppressant drugs and eventually begged successfully for the hand to be amputated every graft of a visible organ leads to an identity split the consequences of which can be very serious if the recipient does not succeed in psychologically accepting the organ and in rebuilding its social expression in everyday life say carosella and pradeu these and other issues are being mulled by uk medical watchdogs as they vet an application by london surgeons to carry out the worlds first fullface transplant professor hwang woosuk arrives for trial to face charges of fraud and embezzlement disgraced stemcell scientist professor hwang woosuk has admitted to fabricating some data that went into a landmark paper but says he was duped by junior researchers into believing the bulk of his teams findings were valid hwang once celebrated as a national hero was indicted in may after prosecutors said he was the mastermind of an elaborate scheme to make it look like his team had produced stem cell lines through cloning human embryos i admit to the suspicion of fabrication he said in court as prosecutors questioned whether he personally altered parts of data for a paper to make it appear as if the team had made more stem cell lines then they had actually produced it was clearly my wrongdoing i admit it hwang has apologised previously for the discredited papers but this week offered the most detailed account of his role in data manipulations that led to the teams downfall he admitted to altering a data sheet given to him by a team member to make it look like a stem cell line had been created in one experiment before the data was given to a us researcher helping to write the paper hwang also said he knew his team did not produce as many stem lines as they had claimed he said he accepted responsibility for a discredited study on developing patientspecific embryonic stem cells that was published in the us journal science a separate investigation panel that debunked hwangs papers questioned whether the team had produced any stem cell lines others implicated he said he was unaware of much larger fabrications in data provided by some junior researchers i believed the test results brought to me by researchers that supported the findings in the papers hwang said not all the responsibility for the fabrications lies with me hwang also denied he broke a bioethics law but said his team did pay for human eggs that had been donated for his study prosecutors have charged hwang with misusing and embezzling the equivalent of us million a in state funds and private donations as well as fraud and violating bioethics laws in procuring human eggs for his research misuse of state funds carries a penalty of up to years jail while violating the bioethics law can lead to three years imprisonment prosecutors say emotional testimony hwang spoke with mounting emotion as he answered questions about the integrity of the science in his teams work we still want to believe the veracity of the stem cell lines which we hope will be verified by a worldrenowned lab not some incompetent committee from seoul national university hwang said an investigation panel at seoul national university where hwang once worked said in a report in january that hwangs team deliberately falsified key data in two papers on embryonic stem cells that have since been retracted by science in a paper hwangs team said it had developed stem cells from a cloned human embryo and in a paper said it had produced tailored embryonic stem cells the reported breakthroughs had raised hopes because they seemed to hasten the day when genetically specific tissue could be grown from embryonic stem cells to repair damaged organs or treat diseases such as alzheimers vascular disease may be associated with particular types of migraine adults who suffer from bouts of migraine without aura have slightly narrower retinal blood vessels than adults without migraine australian research shows the finding supports the hypothesis that microvascular disease may be associated with certain types of migraine investigators note they publish their report in the journal headache a journal of the american headache society dr gerald liew from the university of sydney and colleagues took photographs of peoples retinas as part of the blue mountains eye study the researchers measured the diameters of blood vessels in people over the age of who took part in the populationbased cohort study people with a history of migraine without aura had narrower retinal blood vessels or arterioles than those with a history of migraine with aura or people with no history of migraine the findings held up in analyses adjusting for potentially confounding factors the researchers say gooooal a german scientist has used nanotechnology to create what he believes is the worlds smallest soccer pitch dr stefan trellenkamp from the university of kaiserslautern made the pitch by using an electron beam to engrave lines onto a tiny piece of acrylic glass the pitch measures by nanometres and can only be seen through an electron microscope i am really really proud the nanotechnology researcher says the only problem is that i really dont know what to do with it i cant put it on show as no one can see it he says i guess itll just stay in my drawer for the time being trellenkamp says it took him a whole day to etch the pitch which is so small that of them could fit onto the tip of a human hair a koala retrovirus is integrated into the koala genome and its genetic material is passed from parent to offspring a cancercausing virus is gradually invading the genome of australias koalas researchers say rachael tarlinton a phd student from the university of queensland and colleagues made the unexpected discovery while studying koala retrovirus korv which causes leukaemia and immune deficiencies until now scientists had thought korv was an endogenous virus a virus that has become integrated into its hosts genome and passed from parent to child like normal genes but when tarlinton and her colleagues examined the virus in koalas throughout australia they found that some populations were infected with the virus and others were free of it their findings are published today in the journal nature the researchers also found that korv is highly active and variable between individual koalas suggesting it is in transition between infectious and endogenous forms that was the real surprise says coauthor associate professor paul young that just totally changes what we think about endogenous retroviruses endogenous viruses are found throughout the animal kingdom including in humans but have normally been integrated into their host genomes for thousands of years island life when the researchers studied koalas on kangaroo island off the south coast of australia they found that the marsupials were completely free of the virus the population on that island was established around when koalas on the mainland were being killed by hunting together with other evolutionary evidence this suggests that korv probably began invading the koala genome between and years ago young says early studies he says suggest the virus might have come from asian rodents weve had incursions from asian rodents into northern australia repeatedly over thousands of years he says we think thats probably the route causing cancer because the virus has only recently begun integrating into the koala genome it still often causes cancers the researchers note the koala is having to live with the high levels of cancers and theres not a lot we can do about that in the wild young says for the scientists the new findings offer a rare glimpse into what happens when an animal is faced with a viral challenge like this coming to grips with how the koala handles this initial viral onslaught may give us insights into the dynamic events that occurred millions of years ago when retroviruses first invaded the human genome young says whos that monkeys recognise each other by comparing faces to an average stored in their brains not by memorising what every monkey looks like scientists say and that probably also goes for people explaining how humans can recognise faces in a fraction of a second according to a study published online in the journal nature today the scientists found that a monkeys brain did not keep track of different parts of a face storing and then accessing the information to recognise others instead it keeps a statistical average of the faces it has seen and uses it as a basis for comparison when it sees a new face it compares it to this average and then it remarks upon the differences and that is how the face is seen says dr david leopold of the us national institute of mental health it elucidates how it is possible that you can so quickly and effortlessly in just a few hundred milliseconds recognise faces leopold and his colleagues pinpointed the recognition system while studying neurones in an area of the brain called the inferotemporal cortex in two macaque monkeys the monkeys had been trained to recognise computergenerated human faces the scientists monitored single neurones to understand how groups of the brain cells work together to recognise faces what we found is that the neurones in this part of the monkeys brain respond in a way that is extremely sensitive to the small differences in information between faces of different identities says leopold average face the activity of the neurones was monitored as the monkeys were shown an average face of a person and as it was artificially morphed to the full identity the main finding was a striking tendency for neurones to show tuning that appeared centred about the average face leopold says in psychological tests humans identify faces in much the same way as monkeys so the researchers believe this aspect of the visual recognition system is similar in both species the results suggest that monkeys and possibly humans are primed to recognise minute facial changes facial expression is an indicator of emotion and intent which could be crucial for survival the star shield approaches the line of sight to the parent star at this stage the bright starlight swamps the planet light in the telescope but if the shield blocks most of the starlight planets may be easier to find a huge daisyshaped shield that would block out light from parent stars could be used to find earthlike planets in other solar systems a us astronomer says he and his team have designed a plastic starshade measuring metres in diameter that would orbit with a trailing telescope the shield would block out light from parent stars which would normally swamp light reflected from their planets to enable scientists to map planetary systems finding other planets is very difficult because their parent stars are about times brighter we think this is a compelling concept particularly because it can be built today with existing technology says professor webster cash of the university of colorado who outlines his proposal today in the journal nature we will be able to study earthlike planets tens of trillions of miles away and chemically analyse their atmospheres for signs of life he adds the shield which is known as the new worlds observer would be launched into an orbit about trillion miles from earth and then opened three thrusters would be used to keep it steady while the telescope trailing thousands of kilometres behind follows light from distant planets as it hits the space shield the new worlds observer is actively being studied in academia industry and government cash says he adds that if earthlike planets exist the starshade could find them within the next decade one day a ring of telescopes might be placed on the moon with a fleet of orbiting starshades cash says this would allow scientists to photograph distant planets dvds coated with a lightsensitive protein may be able to store terabytes about gigabytes of data dvds coated with a layer of protein could one day hold so much information that storing data on your computer hard drive will be obsolete says a usbased researcher he says that the protein layer made from tiny genetically altered microbe proteins could allow dvds and other external devices to store terabytes of information professor v renugopalakrishnan of the harvard medical school in boston reported his findings at the international conference on nanoscience and nanotechnology in brisbane this week what this will do eventually is eliminate the need for hard drive memory completely he says renugopalakrishnan says highcapacity storage devices like the new proteinbased dvds will be essential to the defence medical and entertainment industries these trade in terabytes of information with the transfer of information such as satellite images imaging scans and movies you have a compelling need that is not going to be met with the existing magnetic storage technology he says renugopalakrishnan says the new proteinbased dvd will have advantages over current optical storage devices such as the blueray it will be able to store at least times more than the blueray and eventually even up to gigabytes about terabytes of information he says the star at the centre of the highcapacity dvd is a lightactivated protein found in the membrane of a salt marsh microbe halobacterium salinarum the protein called bacteriorhodopsin br captures and stores sunlight to convert it to chemical energy when light shines on br it is converted to a series of intermediate molecules each with a unique shape and colour before returning to its ground state the intermediates generally only last for hours or days but renugopalakrishnan and colleagues modified the dna that produces br protein to produce an intermediate that lasts for more than several years which paves the way for a binary system to store data the ground state could be the zero and any of the intermediates could be the one he says the scientists also engineered the br protein to make its intermediates more stable at the high temperatures generated by storing terabytes of data the flip side renugopalakrishnan says making large amounts of information so portable on highcapacity removable storage devices will make it easier for information to fall into the wrong hands unfortunately science can be used and abused information can be stolen very quickly he says one has to have some safeguards there in conjunction with nec in japan renugopalakrishnans team has produced a prototype device and estimate a usb disk will be commercialised in months and a dvd in to months the work has been funded by a range of us military government academic institutions and commercial companies as well as the european union the telescope a prototype of which is seen here will use tiles to gather radio waves from the early universe an innovative radio telescope made up of square tiles instead of conventional dish antennas will be built in outback western australia to study what switched on the first stars the mileura widefield array which will cover an area kilometres in diameter will use six metre square tiles to gather radio signals from its site in the midwest of the state the array will operate at low frequencies to see through the neutral hydrogen which is opaque to optical light that filled the early universe less than a billion years after the big bang something happened to ionise the neutral hydrogen so that the universe became transparent as it is today says dr brian boyle director of csiros australia telescope national facility the question is what was it massive stars quasars black holes we dont know but by looking at the primordial constituents of the gas and how it has been ionised we will be able to derive some important limits the array is being built by australian and us partners as part of the preparation for the square kilometre array ska a huge international radio telescope scheduled for operation in the ska will require a number of different frontend antennas to cover a wide frequency range says boyle and the mileura array will cover the lowfrequency range mileura a uniquely radioquiet area is australias proposed base site for the ska which if successful will include antennas as far afield as new zealand the mileura array will operate at similar wavelengths used for fm radio and television so if it was built near a big city signals would swamp radio signals from space computer power computing power lies at the heart of the array which will use modern digital signal processing and clever electronics to turn thousands of small cheap fixed dipole antennas into one of the most powerful astronomical instruments in the world the signals or data from each of the antennas can be combined in different ways effectively allowing the telescope to point in any direction although no moving parts are required until recently combining and analysing signals collected from multiple antennas known as interferometry took time as the recorded data had to be processed centrally with the mileura array a supercomputer will process the data instantly in real time csiro has invested a million overall and the us national science foundation has awarded massachusetts institute of technology us million for the construction of the mileura array which will begin in other australian partners include a university consortium led by the university of melbourne which includes the australian national university and curtin university of technology the new combustor injects fuel and air separately into the chamber through devices that look like drinking straws the developers of a new combustion chamber that uses a simple and inexpensive design to burn fossil fuels say it emits almost no nitrogen oxide a big contributor of smog and acid rain the combustor developed by assistant professor ben zinn and his team at the georgia institute of technology is not suitable for the everfluctuating environment of a cars engine but it could replace the steadystate combustion chambers of industry and power generation which the us environmental protection agency says spews more than half of all energyrelated emissions into the atmosphere until now developing a lowemission combustor has proven challenging for a couple of big reasons for fuel to burn it must be mixed with air conventional combustors premix the air with the fuel and inject the mixture into the bottom of a tubeshaped chamber inside the chamber the molecules are set aflame at temperatures over degk at those temperatures the air molecules break down and their two main elements nitrogen and oxygen begin to react and form nitrous oxide and carbon monoxide before the new molecules can be burned they escape through the top of the tube as emissions premixed fuel can also cause flames to flash back burning the fuel nozzle engineers have tried several strategies for reducing flashback and emissions among them burning the fuel mixture at temperatures lower than degk but the lower the temperature the weaker the flame and the more likely that it will experience blow out its like having a very weak candle flame every time there is a breeze it blows out its not very robust says zinn in our system we can go to the lower temps without losing the flame the new device called a stagnation point reverse flow combustor is robust because of its fairly simple design say its developers instead of being tubeshaped it is designed more like a drinking glass open on the top and sealed on the bottom over the top of the chamber is a special injector that looks like a skinny straw inserted into a fat straw fuel flows through the skinny straw down into the chamber air flows into the chamber through the fat straw the ingredients move down the centre of the chamber mix ignite and burn in a lowtemperature flame once they reach the bottom of the chamber the molecules move to the wall of the chamber and begin to rise in an attempt to escape but on their way back up they come into contact and ignite the mixture of fuel coming down ben zinn is one of our countrys best combustion scientists says richard dennis turbine technology manager at the us department of energys national energy technology laboratory he seems to get around two big issues the premixing issue of fuels and air and the flashback issue and he seems to do this in a simple geometry according to zinn when the combustion process occurs stably at temperatures below degk only one nitrous oxide molecule in one million escapes to the environment before such technology could make it to market though it will have to be rigorously tested ben needs to produce more data that validates the performance and does it at conditions that are relevant to the application says dennis zinn thinks that in about a year he could have the device working on residential water heaters or industrial boilers it would take several more years but the combustor could one day be incorporated into gas turbines for power generation and even into aeroplane engines he says current tests for bse need brain or other tissue samples but new research suggests that bse leaves its mark in the blood paving the way for a blood test tests in hamsters suggest it may be possible to develop a blood test for mad cow and related diseases in both humans and animals before they develop symptoms researchers report the study published in the journal science also suggests that the damaged brain cells may leak the infectious prions that cause the diseases offering a chance to detect the disease in blood such a test would allow animals to be checked before they enter the food supply it could also screen people including blood or organ donors for the rare but devastating creutzfeldtjakob disease or cjd and its close cousin vcjd the researchers say current tests require brain or other tissue samples mad cow disease formally known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy or bse is part of the family of prion diseases that also includes scrapie in sheep chronic wasting disease in deer and elk and cjd in people bse emerged in britain in the s and swept through dairy herds some people who ate infected beef products developed a form of cjd called variant or vcjd and at least cases have been identified mostly in the uk people can have cjd before they know it and in a few suspected cases blood and organ donors may have unwittingly infected others silent phase professor claudio soto of the university of texas medical branch at galveston and colleagues infected hamsters with prions the misfolded nerve proteins believed to cause the diseases and then tested blood at various times they invented a technique known as protein misfolding cyclic amplification to accelerate the process by which prions convert normal proteins to misshapen infectious forms with this method for the first time we have detected prions in what we call the silent phase of infection which in humans can last up to years soto says soto and his university have formed a company called amprion to commercially develop the test timing is crucial the test may need to be used at precise times the researchers say it worked best in hamsters days after infection it did not detect prions days after infection then at days after the hamsters started showing symptoms the blood test again revealed prions it has been reported that large quantities of infectious prions appear in the brain only a few weeks before the onset of clinical signs the researchers write heart disease a second study in science shows that mice infected with prions develop heart disease similar to a type known as amyloid heart disease in people dr bruce chesebro of the national institutes of health and colleagues say these diseases are marked by waxy protein deposits that stiffen the heart limit its pumping ability and typically lead to fatal heart stoppage although several types of protein are known to form heart amyloid this is the first time prion protein amyloid has been found in heart muscle and also found to cause heart malfunction chesebro says the plan is to use magnets to attract iron oxide nanoparticles attached to genes magnets may one day drag genes around the body in a novel form of gene therapy says a swiss scientist the magnets would be attracted to iron oxide nanoparticles attached to the genes a concept that has been tested in sheep but many safety tests would be needed before this technology could be used in humans says professor heinrich hofmann of the ecole polytechnique fdrale de lausanne in switzerland hofmann reported his findings at the international conference on nanoscience and nanotechnology in brisbane last week gene therapy has been beset with problems including the lack of a safe and effective vector to transport therapeutic genes into cells hofmann says his iron oxide nanoparticles are safer than commonly used viral vectors which can mutate and influence the dna of cells the iron oxide particle is less dangerous than a virus he says he also says the nanoparticles can be controlled more precisely than a virus because they can be moved into place with a magnet in a recent experiment hofmann injected iron nanoparticles attached to a green fluorescent protein gene into the joint of sheep and used a magnet to move the gene into place the sheep cells produced green fluorescent protein that glowed green under light proving the success of the experiment hoffman says the research has been published in the journal of magnetism and magnetic materials activating stem cells in another application hofmann is using magnets and iron oxide nanoparticles to activate the growth of bone stem cells in vitro experiments have shown that iron oxide nanoparticles injected into stem cells can be vibrated with magnets to boost cell growth we know from a fracture that if you mechanically stimulate the bone then the growth is enhanced he says the healing rate is improved and we are now doing this on a cellular level this work is being patented and is yet to be published safety issues iron oxide nanoparticles are approved by the us food and drug administration for use in magnetic resonance imaging says hoffman but these particles have different coatings not designed to penetrate cells and are cleared via the blood into the liver the iron oxide nanoparticles hofmann uses have a coating of polymers and specific chemical groups designed to help them penetrate cells because of this and because the safety of nanoparticles in general is still being investigated hofmann says his laboratory is careful to contain the nanoparticles to prevent them from escaping he says after doing their job the nanoparticles would be cleared through the lymphatic system into the kidney where they would gradually be cleared from the body but he says there is a risk the nanoparticles could create local inflammation or toxic shock another danger is they could clump together and clog up the kidney says hoffman and many more safety tests are required hofmanns research is publicly funded differences in levels of gene expression between men and women may help to explain why they respond differently to drugs and diseases thousands of genes behave differently in the same organs of males and females researchers report a finding that may help explain why men and women have different responses to drugs and diseases their study of brain liver fat and muscle tissue from mice show that gene expression the level of activity of a gene varies greatly according to sex the same is almost certainly true of humans the team at the university of california los angeles report this research holds important implications for understanding disorders such as diabetes heart disease and obesity and identifies targets for the development of genderspecific therapies says jake lusis a professor of human genetics who worked on the study writing in the august issue of the journal genome research the researchers say that even in the same organ scores of genes vary in expression levels between the sexes the smallest differences are in brain tissue we saw striking and measurable differences in more than half of the genes expression patterns between males and females says dr thomas drake a professor of pathology we didnt expect that no one has previously demonstrated this genetic gender gap at such high levels xia yang a postdoctoral fellow in cardiology who led the study says the implications are important males and females share the same genetic code but our findings imply that gender regulates how quickly the body can convert dna to proteins yang says this suggests that gender influences how disease develops in liver tissue the findings imply male and female livers function the same but at different rates our findings in the liver may explain why men and women respond differently to the same drug lusis says studies show that aspirin is more effective at preventing heart attack in men than women one gender may metabolise the drug faster leaving too little of the medication in the system to produce an effect yang adds many of the genes we identified relate to processes that influence common diseases this is crucial because once we understand the gender gap in these disease mechanisms we can create new strategies for designing and testing new sexspecific drugs the active ingredient in magic mushrooms produces spiritual experiences identical to those reported through history the active ingredient in hallucinogenic mushrooms produces a spiritual experience that can have lasting positive effects a trial has shown the ingredient psilocybin increases wellbeing and satisfaction with life two months after being taken according to the research by scientists at johns hopkins medical institutions which is published online today in the journal psychopharmacology psilocybin is a plant alkaloid that affects the brains serotonin system in particular the hta receptor under very defined conditions with careful preparation you can safely and fairly reliably occasion whats called a primary mystical experience that may lead to positive changes in a person study leader professor roland griffiths says australian professor of psychopharmacology at the university of sydney ian mcgregor says he isnt surprised that the study confirms the ability of psilocybin to induce a spiritual state psilocybin and related hallucinogens have been used since ancient times in religious rituals and this study is really formalising what many people already know he says but he says the apparent longterm benefit of the drug is remarkable to see a positive effect two months later is quite striking he says however the study also reports that about a third of the volunteers experienced fear and anxiety after taking the psilocybin and mcgregor says it should be avoided by anyone with schizophrenia or other psychotic illnesses first study of its kind in four decades in what is described as the first scientifically rigorous study of its kind in years volunteers were given either psilocybin or a comparator drug methylphenidate hydrochloride subjects were asked to describe their experiences immediately after the session in a set of detailed psychological questionnaires and at a twomonth follow up more than of subjects described the effects of psilocybin in ways that met criteria for a full mystical experience according to established psychological scales compared to only of the after the comparator drug after two months twothirds rated the experience as either the singly most spiritually significant in their lives or rated it among their top five the god spot professor john bradshaw an australian neuropsychologist from monash university says the brains medial temporal lobe is rich in serotonin receptors and has previously been described as the god spot because it is active in transcendental states in a commentary accompanying the article professsor david nichols of the purdue university school of pharmacy says its likely that psilocybin triggers the same neurological process that produces religious experiences during fasting meditation sleep deprivation or neardeath experiences he says the current research adds to the emerging field known as neurotheology or the neurology of religious experience and could shed light on the molecular alterations in the brain that underlie religious and mystical experiences the threat of bad weather can leave some people crippled with fear psychologists say if the prospect of bad weather causes you to obsessively monitor weather reports and makes your heart pound head spin and palms sweat you could be suffering from severe weather phobia psychologists say in the first survey ever on this disorder us researchers have found that its more than just thunder phobia or mild anxiety about tornadoes or hurricanes they estimate one in five people could suffer from the condition severe weather phobics are truly panicked at the very thought of storms and cant function normally until the weather clears they get very afraid even when the possibility of severe weather is days away says psychologist professor john westefeld of the university of iowa this is not the normal healthy worry most people have and which motivates them to prepare for a storm they are really really afraid westefeld and his colleagues published the results of a small study of severe weather phobia symptoms among people in the current issue of the bulletin of the american meteorological society a quarter of the people surveyed about how they reacted to severe weather reported enough symptoms to be classified as moderately phobic more than a storm in a teacup symptoms include dizziness shortness of breath nausea heart pounding feelings of panic sweating feeling helpless

really dont know how extensive it is said westefeld its clear this is definitely out there there are probably several million people that have it says zeus flores the creator of the supportive website stormphobiaorg and a selfdescribed storm phobic but flores adds in most causes people are very good at hiding the problem which doesnt help them deal with it often family members may have a clue but not friends and coworkers flores says severe weather phobics can feel an overwhelming dread during storm seasons and some move out of their home towns in my case id sleep in the closet at night with a map and a flashlight to track the storm flores says treating weather phobia flores was part of an experimental storm phobia treatment program that westefeld created in the s the program is based on those that treat people with a fear of flying an expert on the subject in this case a meteorologist is teamed with a counseling psychologist to provide sufferers with more factual information about what they fear and teach them techniques for relaxing one factor that isnt helping storm phobics in the us is the way the media covers storms says flores he says programs like the weather channel just used to provide weather reports now its mtvesque and about getting higher ratings he says carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels has been blamed as a factor in climate change hundreds of deaths caused by volcanic leaks of carbon dioxide around the world are worrying experts who are researching how to bury industrial emissions of the gas as part of an assault on global warming the concerns come as governments and companies investigate trapping carbon dioxide a greenhouse gas released by burning fossil fuels and entombing it in porous rocks deep below the ground but they have done little to explain the vast cost and possible risks of projects that advocates say could bury billions of tonnes of gas and do more to slow global warming than a shift to renewable energies like solar or wind power there may be massive public resistance as weve seen with nuclear power if governments fail to convince voters that storage is safe says dr bert metz cochair of a united nations report on carbon sequestration public acceptanceis a possible showstopper if things are not done properly he said during a recent conference of researchers into carbon dioxide technologies in trondheim norway carbon dioxide is a nontoxic gas produced from respiration by animals and plants making up a tiny of the air levels are up since the industrial revolution and most scientists say the rise is the main spur of global warming deadly gas in pure form the gas can cause asphyxia because it is heavier than air and displaces oxygen in the worst case in recent decades people died after a catastrophic release of million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the depths of lake nyos in cameroon according to the international energy agency thirtyseven people died from a similar seismic release from lake monoun in cameroon in in an explosion at dieng volcano in indonesia released tonnes of the gas smothering people on the plain below in april this year three ski patrol workers died at mammoth mountain california when they were overcome by carbon dioxide while trying to fence off a dangerous volcanic vent carbon storage is not riskfree but we think the risks are manageable says dr philippe lacourgayet chief scientist for research and development at schlumberger oil and gas services group one of many companies involved in research he and other experts say any greenhouse gas stores would be in geologically stable regions far from earthquake zones and commercial carbon dioxide stores are safely in operation in norway canada and algeria proponents of carbon storage say the risks pale when compared with the threats of catastrophic climate change which many scientists say will spur floods droughts heatwaves and could spread diseases and raise world sea levels even so massive storage could mean pipelines and stores under the countryside from austria to australia convincing the public and the public may not take kindly to concentrating a normally harmless gas into a more risky form at a likely cost of tens of billions of dollars a strong argument for public acceptance is that people accept a host of risks every day flammable petrol in the fuel tanks of their vehicles toxic natural gas piped into their homes or electricity generated from nuclear power all sorts of toxic liquids and gases are already stored underground says professor david reimer a lecturer in technology policy at the university of cambridge in england carbon dioxide poses a far lesser risk than many accepted hazards berlin has an underground store for explosive natural gas near the stadium where the world cup soccer competition was played he says and acid gas is stored underground near edmonton canada carbon dioxide storage sites would have to be carefully chosen and monitored for centuries im more worried about public acceptance of the costs than of the hazards of leaks says frederik hauge head of the norwegian environmental group bellona which favours carbon storage metzs un report said that storage could provide of all the cuts in greenhouse gas emissions needed until probably a bigger contribution than from renewable energies or from any revival of nuclear power it estimates that the costs of generating electricity from a coalfired power plant would typically rise to us per kilowatt hour with technology to capture and store carbon dioxide from usus on a power plant with no filters governments will also need to work out liability rules in the case of a leak most experts suggest companies should initially be responsible but governments would take over perhaps between five and years after burial paternal age can have an impact on the health of newborn babies research suggests the babies of older dads tend to be less robust immediately after birth than infants fathered by younger men a new study shows the research published in the current issue of the journal epidemiology shows that new fathers in their s and s are slightly more likely to have an infant with a low apgar score than fathers in their s the apgar score which was first created in rates the newborn on respiratory effort heart rate reflex irritability muscle tone and skin colour with a value of to for each the score is calculated at one and five minutes after birth and a score of is the best result in recent years several reports have linked advanced paternal age with various adverse pregnancy outcomes including foetal death and premature birth but little was known about the impact if any on the physical condition of the infant at birth what the records show to investigate dr yuelian sun from the university of aarhus in denmark and colleagues analysed data from more than couples who had a first infant born between and the team reports that compared with fathers in their s those between and years of age and those years of age or older were and more likely respectively to have an infant with a one minute apgar score between and fathers years of age or older were at increased risk of having an infant with a five minute apgar score of less than the biologic link between advanced paternal age and low apgar scores is unknown sun and colleagues say however some studies have shown that expression of specific paternal genes is crucial for the placental development and that chromosomal aberrations tend to increase with paternal age reproductive medicine expert professor robert jansen from the university of sydney says fathers aged over are also more likely to have children with serious genetic defects in really old men you start getting some rare conditions happening like dwarfism he says professor mark bowman a expert in male infertility and lecturer in obstetrics and gynaecology at sydney university says the results could be a reflection of maternal problems youd expect this would be a female effect he says older women are more likely to have babies with problems and older women have older husbands software that analyses how far your pupils dilate could be used to determine your age the redeye reducing software inside digital cameras could one day be used to verify a persons age us researchers say andrew gallagher a senior research scientist at eastman kodak developed the technique which has a range of applications among them are face recognition security systems ageprogression software to identify missing children and devices that determine whether a person is old enough to buy alcohol or cigarettes we found that the features related to the redeye artefact the pupil dilation are very good features to tell us how old someone is says gallagher who recently filed a patent on the technology thats because as people age the muscles in their eyes naturally weaken making it more difficult for the eyes to dilate effectively in response to changing light conditions in fact the dilation response goes down by a predictable number about one millimetre for every decade a person is alive eyes close together but thats not the only predictable change in human eyes over time a baby is born with adultsized eyes though eyes dont grow the distance between them does using this information gallagher built software that finds the redeye artefact in an image and then based on the distance between the eyes and how much the eye dilates estimates the age of the subject currently the software can categorise a person into general age groups such as baby child teenager and adult its very innovative ive not seen it before says professor tsuhan chen an expert in digital video and image processing at the carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh by itself its one way of recognising the age combining it with other techniques would be the final way to approach this in fact gallagher hopes to combine the redeye feature with other face recognition techniques such as determining the amount of hair hair colour and number of wrinkles to better pinpoint age the idea would be to put as many features together as possible and that would give you the most accurate reading he says applications dont worry no one will be showing up at your next birthday party with a device that calls you a liar in fact kodak has not yet incorporated this technology into a product according to gallagher it will mostly likely show up first as a way to organise and retrieve digital images imagine calling up all of the images of your first baby for instance an internet version of such a system could be supported by links to advertisers selling agerelated products its developers say banknotes and coins are home to fewer bacteria than we think the longheld belief that you can catch disease from handling money may be exaggerated says an australian researcher a study by dr frank vriesekoop a lecturer in food science at the university of ballarat has found there are generally few pathogenic bacteria on banknotes and coins the potential to spread disease is still there but i dont think its all as bad as its made out he says he will present the results of his study at the australian institute of food science and technology annual conference in adelaide today he will also tell delegates that his team found low levels of antibioticresistant bacteria on banknotes and coins vriesekoop worked with new zealand researchers from the eastern institute of technology to look at the types and number of bacterial cells found on money on both sides of the tasman the researchers analysed coins and banknotes from mainly small food outlets such as cafes small supermarkets and shops like butchers and bakers all places where the person who handles food is also likely to handle money back in the laboratory the researchers bombarded the coins with pulses of sound to dislodge any microbes on the surface they then identified and counted the number of viable bacteria the researchers found few bacteria typically or cells per square centimetre some batches appeared to be sterile says vriesekoop he suspects that the copper and nickel in the cent pieces and the aluminium and bronze in the dollar coins are toxic to many bacteria the banknotes needed a different approach they were placed in a device like a miniwashing machine that beats and swirls the notes in a special liquid the scientists then analysed the liquid for microbes this time the counts were higher typically cells per square centimetre and varied much more between samples low levels the researchers found a range of organisms on coins and notes including those that cause food poisoning or diarrhoea these included low levels of coliforms such as escherichia coli bacteria typically associated with the colon and generally linked with poor hygiene staphylococcus aureus a common organism with some strains that can cause disease in susceptible people and bacillus cereus which causes food poisoning if cooking does not kill its tough spores but what surprised the researchers was evidence of salmonella bacteria it did worry me a bit says vriesekoop also surprising was the number of bacteria that were resistant to one or more commonly prescribed antibiotics like amoxycillin roxithromycin and cefaclor this was higher than i anticipated he says potential to cause disease while vriesekoop says levels of bacteria were generally low we still dont know how easily they are transferred from money to humans do they grow or die we dont know says vriesekoop adding that this might be the subject of future research he also hopes to work with the royal australian mint to see how the raised surfaces of coins affect bacterial survival vriesekoop is also coordinating an international comparison of bacterial levels on currency from the us uk and ireland the results which he hopes to have at the end of the year will help to confirm whether australias polymer notes are less hospitable to bacteria than paper notes used in most of the world a chip implanted in the brain records cell activity and sends commands to a computer a paralysed man using a new brain sensor has been able to move a computer cursor open email and control a robotic device simply by thinking about doing it scientists say they believe the braingate sensor which involves implanting electrodes in the brain could offer new hope to people paralysed by injuries or illnesses this is the first step in an ongoing clinical trial of a device that is encouraging for its potential to help people with paralysis says dr leigh hochberg of massachusetts general hospital the yearold man who suffered paralysis of all four limbs three years earlier completed tasks such moving a cursor on a screen and controlling a robotic arm he is the first of four patients with spinal cord injuries muscular dystrophy stroke or motor neurone disease testing the braintomovement system developed by the company cyberkinetics neurotechnology systems this is the dawn of major neurotechnology where the ability to take signals out of the brain has taken a big step forward we have the ability to put signals into the brain but getting signals out is a real challenge i think this represents a landmark event says professor john donoghue of brown university and the chief scientific officer of cyberkinetics first implant the chip the scientists implanted a tiny silicon chip with electrodes into an area of the brain responsible for movement the activity of the cells was recorded and sent to a computer that translated the commands and enabled the patient to move and control the external device this part of the brain the motor cortex which usually sends its signals down the spinal cord and out to the limbs to control movement can still be used by this participant to control an external device even after years had gone by since his spinal cord injury adds hochberg a coauthor of the study published in the journal nature although it is not the first time brain activity has been used to control a cursor professor stephen scott of queens university in ontario canada says it advances the technology this research suggests that implanted prosthetics are a viable approach for assisting severely impaired individuals to communicate and interact with the environment he says in a commentary in the journal faster faster in a separate study researchers from stanford university describe a faster way to process signals from the brain to control a computer or prosthetic device our research is starting to show that from a performance perspective this type of prosthetic system is clinically viable says stephen ryu an assistant professor of neurosurgery at stanford scientists are learning more about how baboons communicate and what this means for the evolution of human language a study of how baboons gesture with their hands suggests gesturing may have been a precursor to human language scientists say the findings could help to explain why humans often gesture with their hands and particularly the right hand when they speak the right hand is controlled by the brains left hemisphere which is the source of most linguistic functions scientists believe communication by hand probably existed in apes million years ago and was a forerunner to spoken and written language french researchers adrien meguerditchian and professor jacques vauclair studied a particular hand gesture in captive baboons the gesture consists of quick and repetitive rubbing or slapping of the hand on the ground and is used to threaten or intimidate others the researchers from the university of provence say this motion might be comparable in humans to the slap of one hand toward the palm of the other hand for the study which is published in the journal behavioural brain research the researchers observed this gesture as it occurred naturally they also triggered it by having a human abruptly shake his head and then glance at a baboon head shaking is another threatening move in the ape and monkey world which includes all sorts of communicative gestures a nonhuman primate can effectively raise an arm to ask a social partner to groom it give another a little slap as an invitation to play touch furtively the hand or genitals of another to greet it slap the ground to threaten the researchers say right hand left hand among the baboons in the test group that favoured a certain hand were righthanded and tended to gesture with this hand other studies have shown that most human babies and deaf individuals also communicate with their right hands there is little chance that our primate cousins will evolve language skills in the near future the researchers say monkeys and apes and their specific communication systems result from other evolutionary roads than those of humans it is very unlikely that the natural selection for primate species will reproduce exactly the same phylogenetic path that gave linguistic skills to humans like chimps william hopkins a us psychology professor at berry college and an expert on the evolution of brain development in primates says i agree with the findings and think this is a very good and interesting paper in many ways the results are nearly identical to those we have previously found in chimpanzees he explains that both chimps and baboons seem to use righthand gestures for communication this suggests the brain is asymmetrical when it comes to language meaning that the left hemisphere tends to dominate it will be interesting to see whether the asymmetries in hand use seen in the baboon link at all to brain asymmetries as we have found in the chimpanzees hopkins adds king penguins are keeping an eye on temperature and current flows in the southern ocean penguins and seals are swimming around the southern ocean with sensors superglued to their heads in the name of science a conference will hear this week the animals are collecting data on water temperature and current flows information that scientists will use to help complete global climate change models the research by a team of scientists from csiro the australian antarctic division and the university of tasmania will be reported tomorrow at the scientific committee on antarctic research meeting in hobart we are using the penguins and seals as oceanographic observers says team member dr steve rintoul of csiro and antarctic climate and ecosystems crc the team has recruited king penguins and eight elephant seals from macquarie island which is about kilometres north of the antarctic continent sensors to measure temperature pressure and location are superglued to the animals heads along with a radio transmitter that sends data to a satellite throughout their journey through the southern ocean as the animals dive down to catch fish metres deep in the case of penguins and metres for seals the pressure sensors tell the scientists how deep the animals are and helps provide a profile of the seas temperature when they return to their home beach on macquarie island the animals moult and shed the equipment which the researchers recover making up for a northern bias our current knowledge about ocean temperatures has mainly come from merchant ships in the northern hemisphere says rintoul the southern ocean has a lot less shipping traffic and so there are relatively few measurements of ocean temperatures there and this says rintoul is the beauty of the penguin and seal oceanographers that swim to places that are hard for scientists to get to they can also deliver many more measurements for example a research vessel might deliver temperature profiles in a sixweek trip to antarctica whereas the strong penguin team delivers profiles over their threeweek journey the seals dive deeper but less frequently and deliver profiles in a six month season one advantage of the seals is they are bigger than the penguins which means they can carry more equipment specifically seals carry sensors that measure salinity which is important for understanding the density of the ocean and calculating the specific speed of currents ocean currents the key rintoul a physical oceanographer and climate scientist says the project is looking at how currents distribute heat in the ocean a key factor in understanding climate and when the heat is released back into the atmosphere it affects the climate in that location he says measurements of the ocean temperature suggests that of total heat increase of the earth in the past years has been stored in the ocean says rintoul in particular he is studying fronts these are areas of strong current within the gigantic antarctic circumpolar current which links all the worlds oceans theyre like rivers in the sea he says by comparing maps of penguin and seal tracks with maps of the fronts the researchers found the animals like to feed near the fronts which make them perfect spies for scientists bacteria remove gold from soil and deposit it on grains where they live scientists say australian scientists have found the strongest evidence so far that bacteria play a key role in forming gold grains and nuggets they have found bacteria that remove gold from the soil and deposit pure grains of it around them researcher dr frank reith from the crc for landscape environments and mineral exploration and colleagues gathered their evidence at two separate mines and publish their results today in the journal science at the tomakin mine on the south coast of new south wales and the hit or miss mine in tropical north queensland most gold is hidden away in quartz veins in amounts that are invisible even to highpowered microscopes but the soil above the mines also contains grains and nuggets of gold that have somehow found their way out of the quartz there are a probably a lot of processes involved reith says he and other scientists have long suspected that bacteria play a part but its an idea that has generated some scepticism to test the theory reith sifted the soil above the mines and collected gold grains l millimetres across and then subjected them to several experiments first reith looked at the grains under a highpowered electron microscope to confirm that they contained bacteriashaped bubbles of gold theyre little lumps on the surface reith says next he looked for organic matter on the grains as evidence that bacteria had been growing on their surfaces finally he used a technique called polymerase chain reaction to look for bacterial dna on the surfaces of the grains to show that living bacteria are still there the dna would have degraded if the bacteria werent around any more reith says about of the grains had living bacteria on them reith says and the only bug that was found on all those positive samples was ralstonia metallidurans these grains come from areas that are almost at the opposite ends of australia reith notes we were pretty happy with that reith thinks the ralstonia bacteria play an important role in the microbial ecosystem in soil helping to rid it of the soluble gold that most other species find toxic this is the guy whose job it is to get the toxic gold out of the environment so the other bacteria can live a happy life he says in the future the goldloving bugs could prove a boon to industry reith says perhaps they could be used to improve gold processing or even be useful as a marker for the presence of gold thats otherwise invisible the researchers could not directly link smoking marijuana with lung cancer but they found evidence of precancerous changes in the lung like oxidative stress damaged tumourfighting cells and dna and tissue changes smoking marijuana can cause changes in lung tissue that may promote cancer according to a review of decades of research on marijuana smoking and lung cancer still it is not possible to directly link pot use to lung cancer based on existing evidence dr reena mehra of case western reserve university in cleveland ohio and her colleagues publish their review in the current issue of the archives of internal medicine given the widespread use of marijuana its use for what are believed to be medicinal purposes and the increasing abuse and dependence on this substance it is important to examine potential adverse clinical consequences the researchers write to investigate whether marijuana smoking might lead to precancerous changes in the lungs or lung cancer mehra and her team reviewed studies analyses of sputum and lung tissue performed in some of these studies found more cancerpromoting changes in pot smokers than in cigarette smokers or nonsmokers these changes included oxidative stress dysfunction of tumourfighting cells changes in tissue structure and dna alterations the researchers report but none of the studies they analysed found evidence that marijuana smoking actually caused lung cancer after factoring in the effects of tobacco use we must conclude that no convincing evidence exists for an association between marijuana smoking and lung cancer based on existing data mehra and her team write increased risk nevertheless the researchers add the precancerous changes seen in studies included in their analysis and other factors do suggest that smoking pot could indeed boost lung cancer risk other factors that could make pot smokers prone to lung cancer the researchers say include the fact that they generally inhale more deeply and hold smoke in their lungs longer than cigarette smokers and that marijuana is smoked without a filter it is known they add that marijuana smoking deposits more tar in the lungs than cigarette smoking does the failure to find a marijuanalung cancer link may have been due to methodological flaws in existing research rather than the absence of such a link the researchers say doctors should advise their patients that marijuana does indeed have potential adverse effects they conclude including causing precancerous changes in the lungs for more information about drugs and their sideeffects see the druginfo clearing house website run by the australian drug foundation helper with dayold pups meerkats actively teach their young how to catch and eat their prey uk researchers say in a study that is one of the first to show such complex animal behaviour while animals are known to learn from one another by watching the team at the university of cambridge says it has demonstrated that the animals actually teach as defined by clear principles older meerkats will bite the stinger off a live scorpion and give it to a youngster to kill and eat and if the pup fails to do the job before the prey can crawl away the older meerkats nudge it back alex thornton and katherine mcauliffe report older meerkats not necessarily the parents will watch youngsters to see how they are doing the researchers report today in the journal science meerkats are a type of mongoose and live in groups of three to in dry regions of southern africa each group includes a dominant male and female who produce of the pups and older animals that help to watch over and rear the young the animals rely on hardtocatch prey such as grasshoppers and various species of scorpions including poisonous ones in the wild the researchers watched different groups of meerkats as part of the kalahari meerkat project in south africas kuruman river reserve they used accepted criteria to define teaching that an individual modifies its behaviour only in the presence of a naive observer that the teacher gets no benefit from its actions and in fact may lose opportunities to forage itself and that the student learns more rapidly than it would have on its own teaching is ubiquitous in human societies but although social learning is widespread in other species it is not yet clear how commonly teaching is involved the researchers write the meerkats demonstrate clearly that they teach and do not merely allow the pups to learn by observing thornton and mcauliffe say a greater understanding of the evolution of teaching is essential if we are to further our knowledge of human cultural evolution and for us to examine the relations between culture in our own species and cultural behaviour in other animals thornton says the larsen ice shelf seen here collapsing in may be under greater threat from faster westerly winds over antarctica heatbearing westerly winds have picked up speed in the past years are likely to be contributing to the melting of antarcticas larsen ice shelf say scientists meteorologist professor john turner of the british antarctic survey says the biggest change in the wind speed occurs in the southern hemisphere summer the ice there on the ice shelf is melted most in summer and that is the season when the winds are increased says turner who gave a keynote talk at the scientific committee on antarctic research meeting in hobart this week antarctica generally has lower temperatures and pressures than areas at more northern latitudes like australia this differential generates storms that take warm air south and cold air north turner says that over the past years the differential appears to have increased and this has increased the speed of westerly winds over the southern ocean by an average of a few knots the increase in speed means the westerlies are now blowing over the antarctic peninsula rather than around it bringing destructive warm air onto the larsen ice shelf to the east of the peninsula says turner he says the pickup in the westerlies will also influence climate elsewhere on the planet by driving the antarctic circumpolar current faster the current shifts vast amounts of water and plays a major role in global heat transfer beyond natural variability while the pressure and temperature differential between antarctica and more northern latitudes goes up and down in natural cycles turner says climate models suggest recent changes are exceptional when compared to the past years what weve seen over the last years is larger than anything in these models he says that suggests that man is playing a part in this turner says an increase in the speed of westerlies ties in with the prediction of more extreme storms in a warming world and he says models also support the idea that increasing greenhouse gases are causing the westerlies to increase although exactly how they are doing so is not known research on the increasing speed of westerlies and their role in melting the larsen ice shelf is due to be published soon in the journal of climate double whammy turner says the ice shelves are very sensitive to climate change because they have ocean beneath them and air above the warm westerlies blowing over their top and the warming oceans flowing beneath are like a double whammy for the ice shelves he says melting ice shelves in themselves dont affect sea level because they are already floating but its their role in holding back ice flowing from the main part of the peninsula that is in jeopardy if you take away these ice shelves the danger is the ice from the interior could start flowing faster says turner he says preliminary research suggests ice is already flowing off the peninsula faster than in the past antarctica holds of the worlds fresh water in the form of ice says turner and if all of this melted there would be a metre rise in sea level the current sea level is rising at millimetres per year as long as water is good enough to drink researchers say its good enough to clean uninfected wounds medical workers in disaster areas no longer have to wait for sterile equipment before they clean and dress wounds thanks to australian research professor rhonda griffiths of the university of western sydneys centre for applied nursing says as long as water is good enough to drink evidence suggests it will be good enough to clean uninfected wounds weve demonstrated that some of the traditional ways of doing dressings are unnecessarily expensive and labour intensive says griffiths she adds that if there is any doubt that the tap water is suitable for drinking it can be boiled before use griffiths and colleagues recently completed a systematic review of evidence for the cochrane collaboration comparing the use of saline versus tap water to clean uninfected wounds the review found that washing wounds including leg ulcers with water did not show an increase in infection or decrease in healing time compared to using saline she says as a result the cochrane collaboration is now recommending tap water is used to clean wounds in developing countries and disaster zones says griffiths in the community community nurses who treat people at home first triggered the investigation into the use of tap water to clean wounds says griffiths while hospitals routinely use saline or sterilised water to clean uninfected wounds community nurses have traditionally relied on people to simply shower before they dress their wounds so in hospitals you had one practice says griffiths and the community had another both practices were based on tradition rather than evidence she says one of the studies included in griffiths cochrane review was carried out by her team it was a sixweek double blind randomised controlled trial in southwestern sydney that studied the healing and infection rate in wounds of patients washed with saline compared with equivalent patients who were washed with tap water we found that there was no difference she says that tells us that if you have got clean tap water that you can drink it is perfectly safe to wash wounds with that tap water if those wounds arent infected griffith says the research is changing the way we think about managing some types of wounds its the cleanliness rather than the sterility thats important she says better for patients and cheaper griffiths says washing wounds with tap water would save money in hospitals especially the cost of the disposable sterile equipment that is required when using saline patients also prefer washing with water she says because they can get out of bed and take a shower while tap water may be safe and effective griffiths still wants to confirm the findings and find out if saline offers any advantages by carrying out a much larger randomised controlled trial she has applied for funding from the national health and medical research council to carry out a trial involving wounds seabirds like this greyheaded albatross can be caught as bycatch but could a stinky repellent ward them off an old fishermens remedy for preventing seabirds from becoming bycatch turns out to be true according to a new study on the effectiveness of shark liver oil at warding off birds using the stinky oil might help save seabirds which often have fatal interactions with longline fisheries these fisheries use a line up to kilometres long often with additional branching lines each line is rigged with hundreds or even thousands of barbed baited hooks seabirds including some endangered species often dive for the bait and fish the birds can become entangled in the lines or injured sometimes fatally by the hooks alex aitken a new zealand fisherman for over two decades uses the traditional shark liver oil as a deterrent sharks themselves are bycatch in the snapper longline fishing industry but government and industry regulations monitor their numbers in new zealand aitken drips the oil into water around fishing boats to deter the birds in he entered his concoction in the seobirdlife international competition for bycatch reduction he won to test the oil scientists johanna pierre of new zealands department of conservation and wendy norden of wildlife conservation group audubon california conducted experiments off new zealands north island the seabird community there includes the endangered black petrel the researchers dripped the shark liver oil from a plastic container at the stern of their vessel while they set out baited hooks on lines as controls they later conducted the same test using vegetable oil and seawater the shark liver oil did not affect fish catches but it did dramatically reduce the number of times seabirds dived for the hooks for example after nine minutes only two or so birds went for the hooks when shark oil was present around birds dived when seawater was used while more than took dives during the vegetable oil trial pierre and norden think the birds might even have been attracted to the vegetable oil but the shark liver oil was a successful repellent their findings are published in the july issue of the journal biological conservation we are not sure what happens when the seabirds smell the oil pierre says however when the oil is released at the stern of the vessel the effect is next to immediate the birds disperse away from the vessel sufficiently far that they cant be seen one or two birds may come in from time to time and do wide looping flights around the vessel but they typically dont land or stick around for long the repellent seems to have more to do with the noxious smell of the oil or its consistency in the water rather than the birds fear of sharks i think its unlikely that they have a negative reaction to the smell of sharks per se this is because the birds have no hesitation to eating shark livers when they are whole and they can also eat shark waste readily pierre explains the deterrent only appears to work as long as the dripping is continuous once the oil flow stops pierre says the birds somehow cue into the fact that the vessel area is now attractiveinteresting not oilynasty though shark liver oil is a natural product it may be problematic to introduce large amounts into marine environments pierre and norden hope the effective ingredients in the oil may be identified and isolated it could be that these ingredients may be found in products other than shark liver oil but this has yet to be determined in the meantime the scientists suggest caution in using large amounts of the oil and hope alternatives such as aerosol mists of the effective ingredients can be developed in the long run cant a man pee in peace not in the us where urinals are broadcasting public health messages if youre a man and the urinal youre standing over is talking to you one of two things is probably happening youre really drunk or the owner has installed a talking urinal in the bathroom lets say for your sake its the receptacle then it must be the wizmark urinal communicator a waterproof disposable drain cover embedded with electronics that senses a visitor and then relays an audio message the device can be programmed to play anything from beer commercials to public service announcements promoting responsible drinking it functions as a point of information and amusement for the male visitor says its inventor dr richard deutsch a chiropractor and bioengineer as well as the founder of us company healthquest technologies deutsch conceived the idea while on a business trip in washington dc on a pit stop to an airport toilet he realised that he was staring down at a drain for about the same length of time as it took to play a commercial he worked as an inventor for several years to develop and patent a prototype and about one year later was under way with mass production how does it work the communicator is a plastic device designed to fit over the drain of standardsized urinals not only does the device act as a deodoriser with a disinfectant base it also contains a proximity sensor that detects someone approaching within about to centimetres a few seconds after detection flashing lights and a prerecorded audio announcement plays the device has a centimetre diameter display area containing a lenticular screen that features multiple images or text that as the person moves toward the urinal appear to change from one graphic to the other just in case you are drunk the wizmark doesnt want to let you get away without a warning aside from advertising its being used to tout antidrinkdriving safe sex and antidrug messages out in the field erm the toilet safety officials in nassau county new york have already acquired copies of the wizmark funded by fines from those caught driving while intoxicated as part of a pilot program to be distributed free to bars clubs and restaurants this is perfect for the target audience we try to reach all of the time and have difficulty doing it says joanne mcgarry the coordinator of nassau countys antidrink driving program mcgarry is asking participating storeowners to fill out a questionnaire about the wizmark to gather information about its

origins of species to charles darwin has now undergone a spurt of rapid climatedriven evolution biologists report the medium ground finch geospiza fortis of daphne island was nudged and then shoved to evolve a smaller beak this happened by the combination of competition from another finch that arrived on the island more than years ago and more recent drought conditions it happened very fast says biologist professor peter grant of princeton university he and dr rosemary grant publish their discovery in the latest issue of the journal science in fact it happened in a single bird generation grant explains the evolutionary nudging began when some larger finches settled on daphne during an exceptionally wet el nintildeo in in the years since the larger g magnirostris finches have been eating most of the larger thorny seeds of the islands puncture vine plants and steadily pushing the smaller finches to rely on smaller seeds from other plants as a result g fortis birds with smaller beaks that did not compete with the larger birds did better and were more likely to have offspring that essentially enriched the gene pool with small beak genes and led to more g fortis with smaller beaks but the matter really came to a head in and when little rain fell on the island and seeds of any kind were scarce most of the birds that had large beaks before the drought disappeared says grant that included almost all of the recently arrived g magnirostris and any remaining g fortis with especially large beaks the only birds that survived enough to mate and produce offspring in were the g fortis with smaller beaks and an ability to exploit small seeds like those of the droughttolerant optunia cactus in darwinian jargon the smallbeaked birds were naturally selected for perpetuating the species just as a dog breeder might select for speed in a greyhound for years this has been the classic textbook example of rapid evolution says professor david skelly an ecologist and researcher of rapid evolution at yale university referring to the competitive pressure on g fortis by the larger beaked g magnirostris when i was a student grants work was sometimes taught as the exception to the rule says skelly that is normally evolution is thought of as slow and gradual in large animals like fish birds reptiles and mammals beak sizes changing measurably in just decades seems awfully fast the galapagos finches were considered an extreme case of quick evolution caused by an extreme environment now it appears that the grants work shows a pattern that is likely to be widespread says skelly who has studied rapid evolution of amphibians in response to global warming environmental changes severe enough to cause sharp population declines as seen with the finches are also selection events as more and more species undergo the stresses of climate change more cases of rapid evolution can be expected skelly says its not likely to save most species facing the climatic bottleneck of course but it does give a few a fighting chance he explains its not unusual i dont think there is any reason to suspect this is an unsual occurrance says australian biologist professor richard shine of the university of sydney shine has charted the rapid evolution of longer legs in invasive cane toads in australia as well as adaptive changes in native snakes where the toads have invaded over the past few decades wed see more evidence of rapid evolution if there was more support for longterm field studies like that of the grants year work on the finches he says its incredibly difficult to maintain these longterm studies implanting false memories can have health benefits like preventing alcohol abuse but is it ethical to brainwash people implanting false memories of a bad experience with alcohol could prevent people abusing alcohol in later life a canadian researcher says dr dan bernstein from kwantlen university college shows that if people are led to believe they once drank themselves sick it can affect their taste for a particular drink he presented the unpublished research conducted over the past year at the th international conference on memory in sydney today in the study people aged were told they had had a bad past experience with alcoholic drinks including rum we wanted to know whether there were consequences to false memory and we looked at whether we could increase peoples confidence that they got sick drinking rum some time in their past bernstein says what we find is that if youve increased your confidence that youve got sick drinking rum you now give rum less preference rewriting the past participants memories were manipulated by telling them that a computer had generated a personal profile based on a questionnaire about past eating and drinking habits they were told they had become sick on rum in the past and they were asked to elaborate on that experience about a quarter of the participants became more confident that they had actually been sick on rum we find that between and increased their confidence for the critical item in comparison to a control group he says when they were asked to rate how much they liked rum they rated it less highly than before their memories were manipulated ethical issues bernstein says if it can be shown that implanting false memories can have a longterm effect on putting people off certain alcoholic drinks it could be a useful deterrent to alcohol abuse if we showed that it had a lasting behavioural effect then it could possibly have some preventative utility but thats a long way off he says professor mike toglia a us expert in false memories from the state university of new york who wasnt involved in the research says bernsteins work offers a new application for this field of memory research he acknowledges there are ethical issues about brainwashing theres always been the concern that implanting false memories is a form of brainwashing and some people believe that maybe this kind or research should be stopped for that reason he says but i think the good that can be done can outweigh the risks beating obesity manipulating memory could also be used to prevent overeating bernstein says but prior bad experiences dont create an aversion to all foods and drinks bernstein says only those with a distinct or unusual flavour with some drinks and some food you may have got sick but it doesnt seem to have this imprint this lasting effect he says he says his previous research managed to induce an aversion to strawberry ice cream but didnt work so well when it came to chips we couldnt turn them off potato chips he says in fact we got a little rebound and they thought give me more ahh i remember this songs we hear as teenagers tend to remain lifelong favourites because they become hardwired into our memory during a critical time a memory conference has heard that critical time is known as the reminiscence bump says steve janssen a phd student at the university of amsterdam janssen presented his research into how we form memories of our favourite music books and movies at the th international conference on memory in sydney this week he says the reminiscence bump can be partly explained by whats called differential encoding or an ability to store events better during early adulthood you recall more memories from the period of to than previous or subsequent periods and the bump has a peak between and he says the brain works at its optimum in that period its a sponge and it soaks up everything we also learn languages and musical instruments best during this time but attachment to songs isnt all about the reminiscence bump he says we also form a particularly personal connection with music from our teen years because we tend to listen to the same songs over and over his research indicates whats your favourite janssen found that when asked to rate their three favourite records movies and books participants in his study overwhelmingly chose items they listened to watched or read between the ages of and while music preferences were strongly linked to the reminiscence bump favourite books and movies were more likely to have been read or viewed recently this is because we usually only read books once or twice and see movies a handful of times but can be exposed to the same song many times he reasons all distributions showed a reminiscence bump so theres evidence that people store events better in their teens janssen says however i also found a larger recency effect for books and a larger reminiscence bump for records so i suggest a kind of interaction between those two mechanisms the results suggest that differential encoding initially causes the reminiscence bump but resampling strengthens the bump janssens presention was based on data gathered through an online survey between january and april this year he analysed results from participants around the world with an average age of including australians you can participate in the study here the epicentre of the magnitude quake south of the indonesian island of java at least people were killed when an undersea earthquake unleashed huge waves on the indonesian island of java echoing the devastating asian tsunami the red cross said today after a strong magnitude quake convulsed the seabed off javas south coast waves up to metres high wrecked buildings and sent boats crashing ashore prompting thousands of residents to flee in panic tsunami alerts were issued for parts of indonesia and australia but they did not reach the victims as there was no early warning system working in the disaster zone according to an official at the geophysics agency in the capital jakarta there are people dead from regencies people are injured and still missing says putu suryawan the official at the indonesian red cross disaster centre adding that people had been displaced from their homes possibly this number could rise because many people are still missing at least five aftershocks rattled the area after the quake which hit around pm local time on monday utc with the epicentre in the sea off pangandaran southeast of jakarta according to indonesias seismology centre indonesia was the nation hardest hit by the devastating december indian ocean tsunami which killed around people across the region we still dont have a tsunami early warning system in place says an official at the geophysics agency in jakarta indonesias islands sit on the pacific ring of fire where the meeting of continental plates causes high volcanic and seismic activity both the pacific tsunami warning center in hawaii and the japan meteorological agency issued tsunami alerts for parts of indonesia and australia after the quake hit a tsunami warning was also issued by local authorities for indias nicobar islands but no immediate damage was reported there or in australia police on christmas island an australian territory south of indonesia say there was no damage there surgical staff leave behind a sponge or scalpel in one in operations but new technology may change that surgeons may be able to use radiotag technology to detect sponges theyve inadvertently left inside their patient a small us study suggests researchers at stanford university school of medicine tested sponges embedded with radio frequency identification rfid tags that were left in eight patients having abdominal or pelvic surgery doctors and nurses then waved a detector wand over the patients which beeped when it found the sponges the wand detected the tagged sponges every time in an average seconds there were also no false alarms when the device bleeped but there was really no sponge there but the researchers say the system is still prone to error especially if people wave the wand too far away from the body or dont scan the correct part of the body the study is published this week in the archives of surgery alex macario a physician and professor of anaesthesia who led the study says the future will probably see a combination of tags and other techniques such as counting instruments and sponges before and after an operation we need a system that is really failsafe where regardless of how people use this technology the patient doesnt leave the operating room with a retained foreign body he says an earlier study found that medical personnel left foreign objects most often sponges inside a patients body in one out of every surgeries causing complications and even death rfid tags are used commercially for uses ranging from tracking luggage and preventing currency from being counterfeited to preventing shoplifting to collecting road tolls the study was funded by the national institutes of health and by a grant from the small business innovation research program using sponges developed by clearcount medical solutions in pittsburgh macario has no financial interests in that company but two of the studys coauthors own several patents related to tagged sponges and work for the pittsburgh company if youre confronted with a familiar situation that seems oddly unrecognisable you could be suffering from jamais vu the first scientific study of jamais vu the reverse of deacutejagrave vu has shown that the experience exists and can be induced an international memory conference has heard jamais vu literally means never seen and describes the sense of unfamiliarity in the face of very familiar things or situations says uk researcher dr chris moulin of the university of leeds if you stare at a word for instance it loses its meaning says moulin who adds that an estimated of people have experienced jamais vu he presented his research for the first time at the th international conference on memory in sydney this week jamais vu is the opposite of deacutejagrave vu or already seen which is a sense of familiarity about an unfamiliar object or the feeling that ive been here before musicians can get jamais vu in the middle of playing a familiar passage its the sensation where you wake up in the morning and turn to the person next to you and feel that theyre a stranger says moulin it can also occur when you look at a face for too long and it begins to look strange or when youre in a familiar place but think i dont know where i am for a brief fleeting moment jamais vu was first recognised about years ago when it was regarded as something of a gentlemans intrigue moulin says but it has never been systematically studied in a laboratory until now brain fatigue moulin says his study shows its possible to induce jamais vu by whats known as semantic satiation which occurs when the brain becomes fatigued in a specific way he asked subjects to write common words such as door times in seconds when they were later asked to describe their experiences showed signs of jamais vu for example after writing door over and over again some participants reported that it looked like i was spelling something else it sounded like a madeup word and i began to doubt that i was writing the correct word for the meaning some thought they had been tricked into thinking it was the right word for a door if you look at something for long enough the mind gets tired and it loses its meaning moulin says moulin says studying jamais vu will help researchers better understand psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia or capgras delusion where people believe someone they know very well has been replaced by an impostor it suggests that this is the normal process that might go wrong in these people they might just have chronic jamais vu moulin says his latest research aims to induce jamais vu and monitor what actually goes on in the brain using neural imaging so tell me about yourself if you go out on a first date with someone and they only tell you good things about themselves its not because theyre being dishonest theyve genuinely repressed their bad points a memory conference has heard celia harris an australian phd student at the university of new south wales has demonstrated that when were courting a romantic partner we are likely to remember only the good things about ourselves while forgetting the bad harris asked male and female subjects to imagine they were going on a date and to list positive and negative things that they would recount about themselves we asked them to think youre going out with this person youve really liked for a long time you want them to think youre funny smart clever a nice person so try and come up with things that would impress them she says positives included getting on well with their mothers having lots of friends and helping elderly ladies carry bags negatives included getting fallingdown drunk failing exams or getting into fights accentuate the positive eliminate the negative after completing a series of tasks and undergoing a brief distraction period they were asked to recall all the negative and positive points about themselves while the participants remembered all the positives they struggled to remember all the negatives harris says her study demonstrates our uncanny ability to selectively forget certain things if we have a motivation such as impressing a new love interest it confirms that motivation drives what we remember and forget she says it supports the idea that there are selective phases of autobiographical memory and depending on the situation well facilitate certain memories for retrieval and inhibit or block the retrieval of others her study is reported in a poster presentation at the th international conference on memory held in sydney this week choosing what to remember harris based her study on retrievalinduced forgetting which says that repeated recall of certain items can impede our ability to remember others participants were split into two groups with one required to concentrate on five negative points in their list and the other asked to concentrate on five positive points while the positive group remembered all their positive memories the negative group forgot half the negative this demonstrates that positive memories seem to be protected against retrieval induced forgetting harris says tsunamihit pangandaran beach the death toll rose towards on tuesday after a strong undersea earthquake triggered a tsunami that smashed into fishing villages and resorts reutersdadang tri indonesians fleeing this weeks tsunami that lashed the south coast of java had no warning with a countrywide early warning system not due to be in place until officials say plans for such a system in indonesia were drafted in the wake of the devastating asian tsunami but only two out of planned sensor buoys have been deployed so far off sumatra not java officials say our system is not yet working properly we are still developing a communication system especially for the regions says fauzi an official working on the early warning project from the meteorology agency in jakarta he says only two sensor buoys were in place on sumatra but that nothing had yet been installed off java edi prihantoro from indonesias ministry of science and technology says even those two sets of buoys and oceanbottom pressure sensors activated off western sumatra last november by indonesian and german scientists were not working according to a grand scenario we will have up to buoys that can monitor ocean phenomena but until now we have deployed only two buoys they have some problems and are on land he says the system was slated to be in place by the end of he says a lack of funds to buy and maintain the buoys was delaying the implementation of the system he says arguing that not only indonesia should pay for its upkeep we still are discussing budget and maintenance but i think other countries must also be taking care of it they get all the ocean data from us it seems unfair if they dont take responsibility for that he says prihantoro says the german and chinese governments had so far donated funds for the system but that it would be expensive to set up across indonesia if installed as planned buoys along indonesias vast archipelago working in conjunction with more than seismographs would detect the speed of seismic waves to determine whether there was a risk of a tsunami data would be analysed and relayed automatically through mobile phone text message or email to officials who could then inform residents but getting the message through to them could still prove a challenge even if java had had a system in place on monday it is doubtful many of the small fishing villages along javas south coast would have received any sms warnings as mobile reception is limited and many people are too poor to own phones it is not enough to warn people through tv and radio the problem is direct communication to communities on the ground says fauzi he says the most direct way to alert residents would be sirens on beaches this year we will build three siren systems in aceh west sumatra and bali we will build one in java next year he says indonesia sits on the socalled pacific rim of fire where the meeting of continental plates causes high volcanic and seismic activity it lacked a warning system when a massive quake hit off sumatra on december unleashing a tsunami that swept up to kilometres inland and killing some people in countries around the indian ocean in less than generations more than half the population of england had anglosaxon genes the anglosaxons who conquered england in the th century set up a system of apartheid that enabled them to master and outbreed the native british majority according to gene research in less than generations more than half of the population in england had the genes of the invaders investigators say the native britons were genetically and culturally absorbed by the anglosaxons over a period of as little as a few hundred years says dr mark thomas a university college london biologist an initially small invading anglosaxon elite could have quickly established themselves by having more children who survived to adulthood thanks to their military power and economic advantage we believe that they also prevented the native british genes getting into the anglosaxon population by restricting intermarriage in a system of apartheid that left the country culturally and genetically germanised he says this is what we see today a population of largely germanic genetic origin speaking a principally german language thomas believes the study published in the journal proceedings of the royal society b answers key questions about one of the turning points in european history what happened after the romans the anglosaxons germanic tribes who lived in presentday germany northern holland and denmark invaded britain in ad after the fall of the roman empire they conquered england but were unable to penetrate far into the celtic fringes of what are now wales and scotland they coincidentally prompted an exodus of britons to what is now brittany france the population of england at that time was probably around two million while the number of anglosaxons was minute the lowest estimate puts the number of migrants at less than some years after the invasion although others put it at more than how could such a tiny minority have ruled a country so emphatically how could it skirt assimilation with the native british majority and impose a language laws economy and culture whose stamp is visible today the answer suggest thomas and colleagues is an apartheidlike social structure that enshrined anglosaxons as the master and the native britons called welshmen from the germanic word for slave as the servants historical evidence evidence for this comes from ancient texts including the laws of ine the late th century ruler of wessex an anglosaxon kingdom in western england ine set down payments of wergild or blood money that was payable to a family for the killing of one of its members in order to prevent a blood feud if an anglosaxon was killed the wergild was between two and five times more than the fine payable for the life of a welshman of comparable status burial sites also provide a pointer about economic and social disparity the skeletal remains of men believed to be anglosaxons are often found alongside a weapon or other precious artefacts whereas those of native britons are usually weaponless and have only one or two objects in previous work thomas team compared the gene pool among native white englishmen in central england today and counterparts in the ancestral lands of the anglosaxons they found that the two groups shared between and of telltale variations in the male sex chromosome y genes to map growth and decline in the latest research he used computer simulations to try to explain how segregation would have enabled the anglosaxons to flourish and the native britons to decline the computer model uses various scenarios involving the size of the immigration influx different ethnic intermarriage rates and the reproductive advantage of being anglosaxon with more wealth and resources apartheid is best known today for the notorious racial segregation that prevailed in whiteminority south africa but the authors point out that there are many other examples in history when conquerors or settlers used such controls to avoid assimilation nurture their identity and maintain their political military or economic supremacy over an ethnic majority by the time of king alfred the great in the th century the differences in legal status between anglosaxons and britons had faded out altogether two centuries later the normans invaded england and imposed their own apartheid giving themselves higher legal status than the britons and allowing norman men to marry native women but preventing native men from marrying norman women sunlight can be a scarce commodity in antarctica and thats affecting vitamin d levels in some researchers scientific researchers spending winter in antarctica might be at increased risk of osteoporosis unless they take vitamin d supplements new research suggests a pilot study presented last week at the scientific committee on antarctic research meeting in hobart suggests some researchers who spend the winter in antarctica have low levels of vitamin d which is making their bones weaker their bone may resorb more calcium and get weaker which can lead to a potential increase in osteoporosis in the long term says researcher dr jeff ayton chief medical office of the australian antarctic division vitamin d is a hormone produced by the action of solar ultraviolet radiation on the skin and is essential for a number of processes including bone metabolism lack of exposure to sunlight decreases vitamin d synthesis and increases bone turnover and bone loss ayton says expeditioners who spend the winter in antarctica have very little exposure to sunlight for seven to nine months but in summer they are at high risk of sunburn unless they cover up with hats and sunscreen ayton and colleagues studied the vitamin d levels and skeletal response to sunlight deprivation in healthy adults with an average age of about years during their winter in australias antarctic program participants were also followed up after leaving antarctica and returning to a more temperate climate bone resorption but not formation was elevated during the period of sun deprivation ayton and colleagues report but they have yet to determine the longterm effect on bones such as the increased risk of osteoporosis it may be that researchers need to receive supplements of vitamin d says ayton or screened for vitamin d levels before they head south ayton says medical researchers are concerned that many people in the general population may have subclinical vitamin d deficiency depending on the latitude of where they live and he says the lower acceptable limit of vitamin d may be revised upwards it may increase from the current level of nanomols per litre to a higher level he says antarctica is a land of extremes and researchers need time to adapt when they get there and when they return flying from antarctica to australia will get polar expeditioners home much faster than by ship but with less time to adjust to everyday life after months of extreme conditions say researchers dr jeff ayton chief medical officer of the australian antarctic division in hobart says research on australian soldiers during the vietnam war suggests that a quick plane trip back could increase the challenge of adjusting to normal life we know that antarctica is a stressful environment says ayton who adds that researchers can spend as long as months there its characterised by isolation confinement and extremities of conditions such as cold darkness and lightness antarctic life also has its own rhythm which is a fair bit slower than life at home he says that it is normal for returning antarctic researchers to use their long ship voyage back home to reflect on their time there and what lies ahead of them a ship voyage normally takes eight to days if you dont get stuck in the ice for six weeks says ayton we have a psychologist on board to debrief wintering parties he says but that is going to change when we start flying people back in four hours ayton and researchers from the university of tasmania are studying the effect of air travel to and from antarctica as part of a larger study on factors that affect the ability of polar expeditioners to reintegrate after their research trips the threeyear study will use the introduction of the air link in approved in last years budget to compare the impact of ship and air travel on journeys to and from antarctica with the change of logistics from ship to air we need to gain an understanding of whether that will make a difference to the reintegration says ayton he says it might be necessary for researchers to see a psychologist before they get on the plane and to get more help once they are at home resilient personalities ayton and colleagues are also trying to find out if researchers and their families or significant partners back home have particular psychological resilience characteristics that may make reintegration more successful such positive personality traits may also help researchers adapt better to the antarctic environment in the first place problems adapting to antarctic life include sleep disturbances fatigue lack of motivation as well as depressive or manic tendencies that can lead to conflicts with others in the group severe problems with work or in the worst case suicide the research by ayton and colleagues was presented last week at the scientific committee on antarctic research meeting in hobart ethiopia showing the east african rift system in the green area and the southern end of the red sea above it the two mighty tectonic plates that form africa and arabia are slowly ripping apart scientists report potentially shifting the southern end of the red sea as a result of this longterm split the northeast of ethiopia and eritrea will be torn from the rest of africa and may eventually form a huge new sea they say an international team of geologists reports its study today in the journal nature geologists from the uk us and ethiopia monitored an earthquake and volcanic eruption in ethiopia in september the event in the afar desert at the southern end of the red sea yielded only small amounts of volcanic material but was hugely significant in terms of geological movement the geologists report using images supplied by the european space agencys envisat satellite and deploying positioning sensors and seismic instruments the geologists were able to get a rare firsthand look at the event an metre rupture developed in the ground in the afars dabbahu volcanic massif over a period of just three weeks and swiftly filled up with molten rock the movement jostled the jigsaw puzzle that makes up the east african rift system a yshaped fault whose stem comprises the great rift valley and whose two branches comprise the red sea and the gulf of aden the east african rift valley is an active divergent rift valley one of the few areas on earth where a continent is being actively separated or rifted by the ongoing forces of plate tectonics the rifting process has been going on for million years and will take millions more to complete the big rip of has no precedent in the era of satellite monitoring which gave the experts this opportunity they theorise that the wellknown segmentation of continental rifts is caused by incursion of magma into the rip rather than by stepbystep cracking of the surface crust antarctic octopuses seen here gave rise to deep sea relatives colder antarctic waters drove the evolution of deep sea octopuses suggests new research australian researcher dr jan strugnell of queens university belfast and the british antarctic survey says the formation of ocean currents around the continent millions of years ago provided the right conditions for ocean creatures to evolve she presented her research on octopus evolution last week at the scientific committee on antarctic research meeting in hobart previous research suggests a range of deep sea creatures had their origins in antarctica says strugnell people have thought for lots of different taxa that maybe this has happened but noones really investigated it properly strugnell decided to test the theory by studying the evolution of antarctic and deep sea octopuses she constructed a family tree by comparing the octopus dna and morphological features including number of suckers using fossils to calibrate evolutionary dates strugnell says antarctic octopuses and their relatives evolved around million years ago and her findings so far suggest deep sea octopuses evolved from antarctic octopuses some time after million years ago strugnell has supported her findings using evidence from a completely different source continental confirmation at various stages in earths history for example and million years ago global climate change depleted oxygen in the deep sea and all the animals there went extinct strugnell says the evolution of octopuses in the deep sea would only have been possible once those waters became oxygenated again and antarctic octopuses were able to colonise them evidence for the timing of this comes from the movement of the continents says strugnell about million years ago antarctica separated completely from south america with the opening up of drakes passage this allowed the antarctic circumpolar current to form which insulated the continent and allowed it to get really cold as cold water is more oxygen rich than warm water oxygen from antarctic waters would have been able to then diffuse into the deep seas along with antarctic octopuses which then evolved into deep sea octopuses the opening of the drakes passage fits in with evolution of the group says strugnell she says its early days but she is confident about her findings this is still a work in progress but the evidence is looking good halfway through my post doc parts of her research have been published in the journals molecular phylogenetics and evolution and cladistics our ability to count emerged in stages linguists say the latest evolutionary stage allowed us to name lanes on a racetrack and as well as describe which runner came in st nd or rd we can thank our verbal nature along with our fingers for the ability to develop complex number systems a new study suggests the authors theorise that language and maths coevolved in humans with language probably emerging just ahead of basic mathematical concepts i do not think counting words were among the first words spoken by our species because their application makes use of a fairly sophisticated pattern of linking that occurred relatively late in linguistic evolution says author dr heike wiese whose study has been accepted for publication in the journal lingua wiese a linguist at the university of potsdam in germany says that our use of counting words and numbers in general probably emerged in four stages during the first stage wiese believes humans began using visual representations such as symbols or other markings to correspond with verbal indications of quantity among the early evidence for that stage is a yearold wolf bone excavated in the czech republic with notched tallies cut into it the second stage of development according to the new study was the evolution of finger counting our hands are like a builtin abacus the physiology that allows us to bend fingers individually also allowed the emergence of our ability to count in sequence during the third stage wiese thinks emphasis began to be placed on the last word or finger in a counting series this emphasis seems to be inherent to human thinking for example when a child who is learning to count is asked how many teddy bears he or she has the child gives the whole sequence of numbers and then puts emphasis on the last word as in i have one two three four teddy bears since humans have fingers that number became a natural transition point during this stage allowing people to count upward in sets of finally wiese believes a fullblown number concept emerged in humans with the use of stable wordlists linked to amounts counting words and numbers he says do not merely refer to numbers they are the numbers the idea is that numbers are not some abstract platonic entities that must be grasped by us but mental tools that we develop ourselves tools we use to assess properties like cardinality four buses rank the fourth bus and identity the number four bus he says counting words and mathematical concepts therefore are intertwined with our language skills and even appear to be dependent upon them though the reverse is not the case some cultures such as the huntergatherer piraha of the amazon have language but do not even possess systems for numbers or counting professor terrence deacon a linguist at the university of california at berkeley agrees with many of the conclusions of wieses study wiese builds the case for numerical cognition growing out of the symbolic cognition at the base of language not as a parasitic spinoff or a mere naming of numerical concepts but as an ability whose roots extend to the same underlying cognitive operations he says several recent studies support the languagemaths link in a study published last month in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences professor yiyuan tang and colleagues found that chinese and english speakers not only have different ways of representing numbers with language they also think about numbers with different parts of their brains yet another study conducted by miamidade county public school researchers in florida found that bilingual individuals do better at maths than their monolingual peers but the impact of racist stereotypes on gamers can be hard to measure say some critics some popular video games promote racist negative stereotypes of asians that would be unacceptable in other forms of media says a canadian researcher robert parungao who studied the topic as part of his honours degree in sociology at the university of british columbia looked at four bestselling games kung fu warcraft shadow warrior and grand theft auto parungao an avid gamer says the games feature evil gangsters all of them nonwhite who function as narrative obstacles to be overcome mastered or ultimately blown to smithereens by the white hero he says while blatant racism is not tolerated in mainstream films or television in video games its below the radar parungao says his study has had a mixed response some say racist stereotypes in games is terrible he says other people in the games community say lighten up its a game you dont have to worry about political correctness a fifthgeneration canadian of chinese and filipino ancestry parungao says that with video game sales at about us billion worldwide making them more popular than movies negative stereotypes matter he admits that not all games or game publishing companies promote such stereotypes but says racism is rife among many of the most popular games which are designed and published mostly in the us and japan these arent just kids toys these are representative of our society and they teach us he says parungaos study is one of the first to look at racism in video games says associate professor richard smith a specialist in technology and society at simon fraser university in vancouver weve heard about sex and violence but i cant remember hearing about racism in video games says smith the most insidious thing about racism is when people accept it studies like this help create consciousness but smith cautioned theres no academic consensus that violence and sexism in media affects realworld attitudes and says the impact of racist images will be hard to measure this is new territory says smith the pharmaceutical industry wants changes in how earlystage clinical trials are run greater caution is needed in early stage tests of novel drugs that stimulate the immune system and only one patient should be given active medicine on the first day a joint industry taskforce says its report was prompted after six men were left seriously ill when a clinical trial in the uk using an experimental drug went badly wrong in march the news triggering widespread public alarm sending shock waves through the pharmaceuticals industry all six healthy volunteers were given the drug made by german biotech firm tegenero ag at the same time professor colin dollery a consultant to glaxosmithkline who cochaired the taskforce says tens of thousands of initial phase i trials are conducted without incident but the tegenero episode highlightes the need for extra care with potent biotech drugs this is particularly the case when drugs activate biological processes in the body rather than inhibit them uk regulators earlier this year concluded that tegeneros drug tgn appeared to cause an unprecedented biological reaction in humans by stimulating the immune system a reaction not seen in animals the great majority of drugs are antagonists in other words they inhibit processes dollery says only a minority are agonists which activate a process if you have a biological drug that is intended to activate the immune system which tgn was then you have to be very much more careful other recommendations from the taskforce which was set up by the association of the british pharmaceutical industry and the uks bioindustry association include improvements in ascertaining the right starting dose staggered dosing as levels are increased and only conducting such trials in hospitals with intensive care facilities privately owned tegenero filed for insolvency earlier this month as the publicity surrounding the disastrous phase i study made it impossible for the company to attract investment to keep operating the trial of tgn which was designed to treat chronic inflammatory conditions and leukaemia was conducted on behalf of tegenero by contract research firm parexel at northwick park hospital in northwest london the joint industry taskforce has submitted its conclusions to a separate governmentappointed expert committee on firstinhuman clinical studies under professor gordon duff which is due to issue its report later this week a loophole in how people set up voip accounts for internet telephony is allowing fraudsters to scam peoples bank account details fraudsters have been sending people emails asking them to phone their bank as part of a novel way of stealing account details known as vishing security experts say internet fraud dubbed phishing where email recipients are directed to a fake website seeking their financial details has been around for several years but government officials and security experts are warning about vishing after a recent case of attempted fraud against a californian bank as opposed to phishing vishing relies on voice over internet protocol voip telephony a way of using the net to make cheap phonecalls the perpetrators take advantage of a quirk in voip that allows subscribers to have a telephone number that appears to be based in a city such as los angeles even though they may be anywhere in the world its a fairly new phenomenon were aware of reports they have been occurring says lisa hone the assistant director of the us federal trade commissions consumer protection bureau the perpetrator or group behind the emails sent to customers of the santa barbara bank and trust in california last month have yet to be caught but the bank has alerted its customers to the scam the email sent to the banks customers preyed on potential victims by requesting they call an apparent local telephone number to clear up an account problem any customers who called the telephone number would have heard a recorded message urging them to enter their account number according to internet security firm websense dan hubbard vice president for security research at websense says the group alerted the bank a unit of pacific capital bancorp pacific bancorp could not be reached for comment but the banks website has alerted its customers to the scheme its definitely a new trend it is growing but it is not nearly as big as the threat of fake websites or criminal activity through malicious code were talking tens of thousands versus a handful hubbard says online auctions affected too but he says similar scams have been attempted against users of the online payments company paypal and on the online auction group ebay ukbased internet security firm sophos issued an alert earlier this month about a vishing scheme targeting paypal as hackers get smarter we are likely to see them increasingly not only set up fake websites but harvest messages from corporate switchboard systems to appear even more like the legitimate company says graham cluley a senior technology consultant at sophos a voipbased fraud can be set up fairly simply according to security experts there are relatively few companies that currently offer such internetbased telephone services and fewer checks are generally required compared to opening an account with a traditional telephone company false voicemail essentially a fraudster signs up for a voip account sets up a voicemail recorded message system mimicking that of an actual bank or other company then mass emails consumers urging them to call the false number hone says the scam as in the california case can appear legitimate to unsuspecting consumers because voip accounts can be set up with local telephone codes of a users choice in a variety of cities or states one voip account can have numbers all over the country the code makes it look more real and setup is easy hone says you can lose weight on a high carbohydrate diet but not all carbs are equal theres no difference between a low gi diet and a high protein diet when it comes to losing weight an australian study has shown the study published in the archives of internal medicine today is the first to directly compare high protein diets and those based on foods with a low glycaemic index or gi but the research shows low gi diets are better than high protein diets in reducing bad or ldl low density lipoprotein cholesterol associated with cardiovascular disease in terms of weight and fat loss a low gi diet and a high protein diet were exactly the same there was no difference in terms of weight or fat loss between those two studies reports lead author joanna mcmillanprice from the university of sydneys human nutrition unit professor jennie brandmiller who coauthored the low gi diet revolution with mcmillan was also involved in the research turning carbohydrates into glucose low gi diets were originally used to control diabetes because of their ability to prevent dramatic fluctuations in insulin levels the body takes longer to convert low gi foods to glucose which means glucose is released into the bloodstream more slowly preventing spikes in insulin levels that can leave you feeling hungry and prevent the breakdown of fat more recently low gi diets gained popularity among dieters with celebrities like kylie minogue reported to favour low gi foods highly processed low fibre foods like white bread and soft drinks have a high gi while foods like dark whole grain breads fruit and legumes have a low gi fat or cholesterol the researchers put overweight men and women on one of four diets for weeks of those four one was low gi and another was high in protein at the end of the study both the low gi and high protein group had lost the same amount of weight a third diet which was heavy on carbohydrates with a high gi achieved the slowest rate of weight loss while ldl cholesterol declined significantly in the low gi group it increased among the people on the high protein diet mcmillanprice says the research not only suggests that a low gi diet is the best eating choice but it also vindicates the consumption of the right kind of carbohydrates for those wanting to lose weight for so long now weve had hype that its all about high protein and we must reduce our carbs mcmillanprice says its been a confusing message and its quite reassuring to hear that yes i can eat a high carb diet as long as im smart about the carbs i choose high protein or low gi dr peter clifton research director at csiro human nutrition says the study shows that both high protein and low gi diets can reduce weight certainly the study doesnt provide any evidence low gi diets are the best theyre an equivalent says clifton who coauthored the bestselling csiro highprotein total wellbeing diet clifton says high protein diets also provide more zinc and iron that a high carb diets and are more likely to leave you feeling fuller for longer but the study shows that if you dont like eating large amounts of protein then choosing low gi products is probably not bad alternative he says mcmillanprices study received funding from meat and livestock australia can modern technology help solve the secrets of egypts ancient pyramids archaeologists who measured the egyptian pyramids at giza more than years ago were surprisingly accurate a review of historical surveys has shown the paper posted online by australias queensland university of technology reviews the major surveying projects of the pyramids cheops chephren and mycerinus built around bc south of whats now cairo they werent that far out their surveys were quite diligent and systematic and were getting fairly good agreement using modern technology says the papers coauthor robert webb a lecturer in surveying in the school of urban development but webb says laser scanning computer modelling and other modern technology hasnt brought us any closer to answering one of the most intriguing questions about the pyramids this is whether their position and measurements deliberately reflect the alignment of the planets and stars earlier surveys have found a very close relationship to the planet alignments and what we can measure on the ground he says but its more of a theory and some people have also found while the similarities appear on the surface to be quite close its just really one of those mathematical flukes according to the review the two major historical surveys of the pyramids were made in and using wire steel tape and mahogany rods the most recent attempts to map the pyramids have used laser scanning gps satellite imaging digital technology and computer visualisation questions of alignment the survey by sir william flinders petrie concluded that there was no spatial connection between the distances and directions of the pyramids and anything else but theories since then have suggested the spatial relationship of the pyramids reflected the alignment of orions belt and the orbital path of mercury mars and venus other theories have included suggestions that the perimeter of the great pyramid or cheops of pyramid inches is equal to the number of days in years and the number of books of ancient wisdom credited to the egyptian god thoth a pyramid inch the basic unit used in measuring pyramids is just a fraction over one inch webb says initiatives like the university of chicagos giza plateau mapping project have revealed peculiar alignments inside the pyramids that could possibly shed more light on alignment theories computer visualisation of the insides of the pyramids and their chambers has the potential to really reveal some relationships we may not know about as yet he says but he says that mystery still surrounds the pyramids in reality we will never know what inspired the ancient egyptians to position the pyramids as they did the paper concludes exposure to cosmic radiation and microgravity is expected to generate superseeds and superplants china plans to blast seeds into space in a novel way of boosting the nations food production reports say scientists hope that exposure to cosmic radiation and microgravity will cause genetic mutations in the seeds that will improve crop yield back on earth some seeds will go into orbit as part of a twoweek mission aboard a recoverable satellite shijian the china daily newspaper reports this is set to be launched by a long march c rocket in early september the seed satellite will enable scientists to try to cultivate highyield and highquality plants sun laiyan head of the china national space administration told the paper exposed to special environments such as cosmic radiation and microgravity some seeds will mutate to such an extent that they may produce much higher yields and improved quality the paper says nine categories of seeds including grains cash crops and forage plants will be aboard the satellite it says china has been experimenting with spacebred seeds for years with rice and wheat exposed to the universe resulting in increased yields the paper says spacebred tomato and green pepper seeds have resulted in harvests larger than ordinary seeds while vegetables grown from spacebred seeds have a higher vitamin content it adds however the satellite to be launched in september will be the first dedicated specifically for seeds chinas space seed experiments come as the nation seeks ways to feed its billion people amid a rapid decline in farming land due to swift industrialisation the nation has pursued some forms of genetically modified crops with gmo tomatoes soy beans and corn already in production china is also mulling plans to approve the production of genetically modified rice scotty revisits final frontier in other space news the remains of actor james doohan who played scotty on star trek will be blasted into space in october the company organising the flight says the actor who inspired the catchphrase beam me up scotty even though it was never actually uttered on the show died a year ago at the age of houstonbased company space services originally planned to blast doohans remains into space last year but the flight was delayed to allow more tests on the rocket the company previously blasted the remains of star trek creator gene roddenberry into space in an artists impression of a spacecraft exploring the icy kuiper belt researchers say they have found the first evidence that the frozen outer reaches of our solar system could be littered with many more objects than we think astronomers have been trying to get a picture of the region known as the kuiper belt because it is believed to contain debris from the birth of our solar system and so could tell us how planetary systems form about large bodies including pluto and the recently discovered xena have been located in the kuiper belt so far but smaller objects have evaded detection as they are about billion kilometres from the sun making it impossible to see them even with a powerful instrument like the hubble space telescope now an australian team from the university of new south wales unsw and the angloaustralian observatory aao has used optical fibre technology to detect signs of smaller kuiper belt objects for the first time the wink of a star they did this by observing splitsecond winking or darkening of stars which suggests a kuiper belt object is passing in front or occulting the star unsw student george georgevits presented his research at a recent workshop attended by international kuiper belt experts in italy his colleague associate professor michael ashley of unsw says the observations offer the first evidence the kuiper belt contains many more relics of the infant solar system than estimated basically our observation showed that that are many more maybe five or times as many of the smaller objects than theory predicted he says ashley says georgevits and fellow researcher dr will saunders of the aao found evidence of many objects ranging in size from metres to one kilometre across using a df instrument on the uk schmidt telescope at siding spring the df which uses fibre optics monitored stars simultaneously over two weeks the equivalent of star hours or watching a single star every night for years weve got fibres each one of which is positioned on a star and then we feed the fibres into a high speed camera he says a fraction of whats out there ashley says its been suggested there are around billion objects in the belt but the latest observations suggest this could represent only a fraction of whats there we saw at least very definite occultations and as you look for smaller less significant events we could have seen up to he says the kuiper belt community has greeted the news with some scepticsm some critics say that the apparent dimming of the stars may be due to effects in the earths atmosphere ashley says the scientists took pains to rule out other possible causes for dips in stars including moths in the telescope but this research wont turn a pot belly into a flat stomach stem cells taken from human fat can be transformed into smooth muscle cells offering a way to treat diseases of the heart gut and bladder us researchers report while the experiment does not quite offer a way to turn a pot belly into a flat stomach the researchers say the transformed cells contracted and relaxed just like smooth muscle cells these cells help the heart beat and blood flow push food through the digestive system and make bladders fill and empty the researchers report their study published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences today is the latest to show that fat can be a rich source of the bodys master cells fat tissue may prove a reliable source of smooth muscle cells that we can use to regenerate and repair damaged organs says dr larissa rodriguez an assistant professor in the urology department at the university of california los angeles medical school rodriguez and colleagues incubated adiposederived stem cells in a nourishing mixture of growth factors human proteins that encouraged the cells to become smooth muscle cells the researchers say scientists have been looking for sources of smooth muscle for organ repair and treating heart disease gastrointestinal diseases and bladder dysfunction a major obstacle for such an approach has been finding a reliable source of healthy smooth muscle cells that can be safely harvested and that require minimal manipulation they write clean healthy fat one approach has been to take a patients own cells from an organ but studies have shown that stem cells taken from a diseased organ are also damaged and do not work well when scientists try to grow them in the lab for a transplant transplants grown from a patients own fat could be used with no need for antirejection drugs rodriguez says smooth muscle cells have been produced from stem cells found in the brain and bone marrow but acquiring stem cells from fat is much easier she adds the stem cells found in fat are known as multipotent stem cells they can produce a variety of cell and tissue types but are not as flexible as embryonic stem cells others also looking at fat many groups have been looking to fat as a source of stem cells in april cytori therapeutics said it was starting a clinical trial to test whether stem cells derived from fat can be used to regenerate breast tissue other researchers have been trying to get stem cells from liposuction specimens in a second study published in the same journal uk researchers say they found one important protein that keeps stem cells in a quiescent and nondividing stage dr fiona watt of cancer research uk and colleagues studied stem cells from human skin and found a protein known as lrig kept the skin cells from proliferating when lrig production was silenced the stem cells began growing and dividing the finding may not only offer important information to stem cell researchers but may also offer insights into cancer watts team says in cancer cells ignore the normal signals from the body and proliferate uncontrollably the protein is also involved in psoriasis the mud in this cave is formed from million yearold clay the jenolan caves west of sydney date back some million years making them the oldest known open caves in the world australian geologists say dr armstrong osborne from the university of sydney and colleagues used clay dating methods to show the caves have been open since the carboniferous period their results are published in a recent issue of the australian journal of earth sciences weve shown that these caves are hundreds of millions of years older than any reported date for an open cave anywhere in the world osborne says the oldest previous dating for an open cave was around million years he adds even in geological terms million years is a very long time to put it into context the blue mountains began to form million years ago dinosaurs became extinct million years ago and tasmania was joined to the mainland as recently as years ago until recently scientists had thought the caves were relatively young but osborne thought the underground system might be older it always struck me as weird that in a country where everything is so old that the caves should be young he says the challenge was finding something inside the caves that could be accurately dated so when a chance meeting revealed that dr horst zwingmann from csiro petroleum resources had a technique that could be used to date the clay inside the caves they set about finding their real age borrowing from the oil industry the researchers used dating methods developed to help oil exploration companies find oil deposits the techniques are based on potassiumargon dating which can calculate the age of minerals by measuring levels of decay caused by radioactive potassium the results were a complete surprise no one imagined that they would be more than million years old this was totally off the planet osborne says we were able to provide evidence that the clays did form insitu in the caves and that the sections regularly visited by tourists actually formed in the carboniferous zwingmann says the clay now forms much of the mud in the popular temple of baal and orient caves the discovery opens the possibility that there could be evidence of other ancient geological events in the caves that scientists havent looked for yet for example the researchers think the clay in the cave was formed when volcanic ash entered irradiation could be a way of inactivating bacteria used to make vaccines vaccines made with bacteria killed by gamma rays may be more effective than those made using standard heat or chemical inactivation us government researchers say such vaccines do not have to be kept cold the team at the university of california san diego school of medicine report in the journal immunity dr sandip datta and colleagues made a vaccine from listeria monocytogenes bacteria a common cause of food poisoning the listeria were killed with gamma rays and the vaccine protected mice infected with live listeria unlike vaccines made with heatkilled bacteria although completely inactivated by the radiation and thus unable to cause illness irradiated bacterial pathogens evidently retain characteristics that prompt the immune system to mount a fullfledged defence datta says vaccines can be made in three ways using an attenuated or weakened form of live bacteria or virus using a killed microbe or using pieces of dna from a bacteria or virus most attenuated vaccines must be kept cold but the researchers found that mice could be protected by vaccination with irradiated listeria that had been freezedried into a powder this might mean that such vaccines could be used in hot places without electricity the researchers say vaccines often protect mice but not people so the idea must be tested more the researchers note dr elias zerhouni head of the national institutes of health which funded the study says this advance is potentially of great importance in meeting the challenge of creating vaccines that are safe effective and simple to manufacture and transport gamma rays are also used to sterilise medical equipment and in some countries to preserve food scientists are still working out how to measure objects accurately at the nanoscale some of the smallest things in the world are so small that not even the scientists making them know how tiny they are the scientists cant seem to agree how to accurately measure these nanotechnologies which commentators say is an important step in making sure they work properly and their risk is minimised accurately measuring the size of nanomaterials is crucial because nanotechnology relies on novel properties that emerge at the nanoscale and its important in safety assessment because particles under a particular size may be dangerous to human or environmental health dr john miles manager of nanometrology at australias national measurement institute in melbourne is one of the scientists trying to work out how to accurately measure nanotechnology such as nanoparticles measurement at this level is an extremely difficult thing to do because its so much smaller than the things we normally deal with getting down to almost atomic dimensions says miles who is on an international committee responsible for setting measurement standards for nanotechnologies but if you have an ovalshaped nanoparticle for example do you measure its width or length and how do you measure a nanoparticle with a rough surface the shape and surface smoothness of a particle become important when measuring at the nanoscale miles says because the particles themselves are about the same size as things like surface irregularities depends on the lab miles says studies have shown that different labs even using the same measuring technique have delivered very different measurements of nanoparticles for example nanopolystyrene spheres which suppliers say are nanometres in size have been measured as being nanometres smaller or bigger depending on who is measuring them he says and measurements of silver nanoparticles have been nanometres smaller or bigger depending on the lab says miles nanometrologists dont yet know whether suppliers are producing unreliablysized particles or whether those measuring them are getting it wrong there is a need worldwide for a quick convenient way of measuring nanoparticle sizes says miles if someone could come up with a way of doing that they would make a lot of money scattering light the most practical machine being developed for the job uses what is called dynamic light scattering dls this technique shines laser light onto a solution of nanoparticles and measures their brownian motion the jiggling that happens when nanosized particles are bombarded by other molecules the smaller the particles the more they jiggle and the trick is to accurately calibrate their jiggling with standard metric measurements miles says his institute is working on a dls device to calibrate nanopowders as reference standards for industry but he says the instrument is three or four years away nanorulers an alternative in the meantime is to use an electron microscope to image the particles and then a nanoruler to measure them the problem is that this method is timeconsuming because it only measures relatively few particles at a time whereas dls can quickly measure an entire batch of particles in one go there is currently no regulatory requirement for the billiondollar nanotechnology industry to use reliable measuring devices drizzle one day flash floods the next its raining methane on saturns giant moon titan scientists say it ranges from a persistent drizzle that keeps the surface of saturns largest moon damp to fierce storms that could produce huge droplets we have found the first evidence of drizzly rain on a remote planet in this case titan which consists of liquid methane and a little bit of nitrogen says dr tetsuya tokano of germanys university of cologne tokano and his colleagues publish their findings today in the journal nature the researchers used data from the nasaeuropean space agency cassinihuygens mission to measure the atmospheric chemical composition temperature and pressure on titan the cassini craft was launched in and reached saturn in after cruising past venus and jupiter information from the probe showed titan which is larger than the planet mercury is cold and windy with a dense atmosphere of methane and nitrogen according to the teams findings much of the surface of titan could experience a drizzle for the next few years fierce storms too in a separate report in the journal researchers from spain modelled titans atmosphere they predicted clouds over the south pole would produce fierce storms that would pound the surface and could help explain the formation of its river valleys dr ricardo hueso and dr agustin sanchezlavega of the university of pais vasco in bilbao say under the right conditions the storms could produce methane raindrops up to millimetres across that would pound the surface similar to flash floods seen on earth tokano says although the spanish researchers reached a different conclusion he believes both types of rainfall could occur on titan depending on the conditions we do not rule out the presence of such heavy rainstorms because such clouds have been observed near the south pole he adds adult top and juvenile bottom umoonasaurus one of two new species of ancient marine reptile scientists have identified two new species of ancient marine reptile that swam in an australian outback sea million years ago the reptiles named umoonasaurus and opallionectes belonged to the plesiosaurs group which included a predator like a killer whale from the jurassic period says palaeontologist dr benjamin kear from the university of adelaide kear whose team studied opalised fossils mainly from around the outback mining town of coober pedy in south australia publish their research in the latest issue of the journal palaeontology and online in the journal biology letters kear says the longnecked marine reptiles swam in the shallow water of an inland sea that once existed in central australia freezing polar water covered large parts of australia million years ago when the island continent was much closer to antarctica the umoonasaurus was about metres long and had three crestlike ridges on its skull imagine a compact body with four flippers a reasonably long neck small head and short tail much like a reptilian seal kear says the team named the reptile after the aboriginal name for coober pedy umoona the opallionectes was metres long with masses of needle teeth used to trap small fish and squid its name means the opal swimmer from andamooka the scientists say kear says most of the fossils found were of juvenile creatures leading the scientists to believe they had discovered a seasonal breeding ground for the ancient reptiles lightdetecting fibres could oneday be used to capture images from space move over digital cameras imaging with special lightdetecting fibres may be on its way researchers from the massachusetts institute of technology mit have developed a crisscrossing web of transparent fibres that senses the direction intensity and phase of light in d it does this without lenses filters or detector arrays typically used for the task the lightweight fibres could be used to make space telescopes that unfurl saillike imagers say the scientists alternatively interactive computer screens made with the fibres could respond to light instead of mouse clicks and fibres in electronic clothing could oneday sense the environment better than the wearer we have shown already that these very simple fibre arrays can extract images without a lens says yoel fink an associate professor of materials science at mit fink with postdoctoral associate ayman abouraddy and colleagues publish the results in the latest issue of the journal nature materials in conventional imaging systems the lens is a crucial component as it focuses the light onto the detector surface whether that is a lightsensitive film or computer chip but in finks system a software algorithm does the work of the lens after light hits the photodetecting fibres its a completely new way of doing things says eli yablonovitch professor of electrical engineering at university of california los angeles fibres have three elements the fibres are millimetre in diameter and have three elements a semiconducting core flanked by metal conductors all encircled in an insulating shell of a polymer weaving the fibres together produces a screenlike product with unique coordinates for each location where two fibres intersect with this method scientists can pinpoint where on the grid light is shining placing one screen in front of another or forming one screen into a sphere as the team did in laboratory tests provides even more detail light passes through a coordinate on the facing screen and through another coordinate behind so the scientists determine where the light came from by drawing an imaginary line through the two coordinates at the same time the fibre is collecting information about the light including its intensity and the frequency of the light waves a software algorithm then calculates how the light would change if it passed through a lens and uses the answer to generate a picture of the lights source light from all directions whereas conventional imaging systems have a limited field of view finks system can sense light coming from all directions the beauty of this is that they are able to make this threedimensional detection and to do so with an object that is essentially transparent says malvin teisch professor of physics and electrical and computing engineering at boston university finks team is working on fibres that can sense a wider range of light wavelengths to produce colour images as well as ones that can read heat and sound sensitive tastebuds may explain why your kids wont eat broccoli carrots or cucumbers picky kids who wont eat vegetables may be particularly sensitive to bitter flavours a new study shows these preschoolers turn up their noses at not only bitter vegetables like broccoli and olives but sometimes also sweeter vegies like carrots and red peppers the findings suggest that innately sensitive tastebuds help explain why some children are so staunchly opposed to vegetables the study authors report in the latest issue of the american journal of clinical nutrition in recent years scientists have identified a gene dubbed tasr that controls a receptor for bitter flavour a study published last year found that children with certain variations of that gene are particularly sensitive tasters able to detect a very small amount of a bittertasting compound in water the preschoolers in the current study were tested the same way a total of said the water tasted yucky or bad while the rest couldnt taste anything and were considered nontasters when the children were given free range to snack on bittertasting vegetables broccoli olives and cucumbers and sweeter ones carrots and red peppers the sensitive kids ate significantly fewer bitter vegetables and while only of nontaster children refused all of the vegetables of the sensitive tasters did so at the dinner table so what should parents make of all this according to the researchers parents of fussy eaters should recognise that their children may not be having the same taste experience that they are parents should try not to project their own food preferences onto their children says study coauthor dr beverly tepper a professor of food science at rutgers university a nontaster parent who loves broccoli for instance may have a more bittersensitive child who simply doesnt enjoy the greens in the same way she says but that doesnt mean that bittersensitive kids are destined to shun vegetables their whole lives a potential comfort to parents who regularly engage in mealtime struggles we do change our food preferences as we grow and learn tepper says noting that the impact of genetics isnt set in stone whether theres a more immediate fix to the bittersensitivity issue is unclear a tasty sauce might make vegetables more palatable to a sensitive child but dousing veggies with toppings may not be the most nutritionally sound choice tepper says serving vegetables cooked rather than raw might help she says as cooking takes some of the bite out one day we may be able to make stronger nylon by starting at the nanoscale a us scientist has made the worlds smallest fragment of nylon and hopes to make more by harnessing the selfassembling properties of dna professor nadrian seeman of new york university says the longterm plan is to make ultra strong nylon he gave a paper on his work at the recent international conference on nanoscience and nanotechnology in brisbane the same properties of dna that make it such a wonderful genetic material can be utilised in other ways says seeman a pioneer of what is called structural dna nanotechnology in nature dnas bases enable it to pair up with and attach to another strand of dna to form a linear double helix seeman is exploiting this ability of dna to selfassemble to make his nanonylon but he is using synthetic dna that can form branches rather than linear lines you can make lattices you can make networks you can make objects you can make all sorts of things with branched dna whereas with linear dna youre just making a long line he says seeman has been working on a synthetic version of a related molecule rna which also selfassembles so far hes attached chemical groups used to make nylon to fragments of synthetic rna to make the equivalent of a single molecule of nylon thats about the shortest piece of nylon you can make he says he is now working on making larger pieces of nylon using dna the plan is to knit the nanonylon into a form of molecular chain mail which would make a much tougher and stronger fabric than currently exists but says seeman this is a longterm project this is very hard chemistry he says revealing that it took seven years to work out how to attach the nylon components to dna bottomup assembly nearly years ago scientists amazed the world by writing the worlds tiniest corporate logo in atoms the tiny ibm logo was made using a large machine that laboriously placed each atom in place seemans research is part of a different approach to assembling things at the atomic or molecular level were talking about making things from the bottom up he says unit by unit the approach involves mixing synthetic dna molecules in a solution to assemble vast amounts of desired molecular structures seeman says molecular selfassembly can also be used to organise nanoelectronics an idea he first raised in this would involve attaching molecules that conduct electricity such as carbon nanotubes to dna so far seeman has demonstrated the concept by attaching gold nanoparticles to dna he says his work could also be used as a tool in the imaging of biological molecules including drug receptors which in turn will be useful in drug design seeman is funded by the national institutes of health the national science foundation nanoscience technologies incorporated and the us military the vehicle combines the best of a helicopter and fixed wing aircraft say researchers it stands metres high and has a wingspan of metres a new unmanned aerial vehicle uav that takes off vertically like a helicopter and then flips over to fly forward like a conventional plane is being developed by australian researchers the twing could provide cheaper and more efficient surveillance and reconnaissance says dr hugh stone of the university of sydney whose team has been carrying out test flights it can take off and land like a helicopter says stone an aeronautical engineer who began the research as a phd project it doesnt need a runway while helicopters can take off and land vertically and can hover they are not as efficient at forward flight as conventional aircraft which means they dont tend to fly as fast or as far this is why convertiplanes were developed aerial vehicles that convert from helicopter to plane mode other uav convertiplanes use helicopter type propeller blades and more complex and expensive technology to control the movement of the vehicle says stone but the twing uses fixed propellers like a standard aircraft moving flaps that sit in the airstream behind the propellers are responsible for changing the direction of the aircraft and allow it to hover these flaps are controlled by an onboard computer system that detects and changes the planes location and orientation we can basically tell it a set of points in space and we upload those to the vehicle and then it will fly through those points says stone it doesnt need any intervention from us unstable like other similar vehicles the twing is quite unstable and the flaps have to move times a second to keep the vehicle hovering while it is not possible to fly the aircraft by radio control from the ground it is possible to communicate with the onboard computer system in an emergency we can intervene if something starts to go wrong says stone so far the team has successfully tested a prototype that is metres high with a metre wingspan and weighs kilograms in the tests the aircraft flew autonomously except while landing when it had some assistance from radio control on the ground the team plan to do further testing in december surveillance stone says uavs are generally equipped with cameras and used for surveillance and reconnaissance the research has been funded by the australian research council the university of sydney and a us grant a from the us air force stone says his team is working with australian technology company sonacom to develop a commercial version of the aircraft for surveillance applications new research into how hiv replicates in the gut may help to explain why antiviral therapy doesnt work for all patients hiv replicates in the lining of the gut and does much of its damage to the immune system there researchers say professor satya dandekar at the university of california davis health system and colleagues report their findings in the latest issue of the journal of virology dandekar says the study is the first to explain why the drug cocktails that hiv patients take so often fail to work completely the real battle between the virus and exposed individuals is happening in the gut immediately after viral infection she says we need to be focusing our efforts on improving treatment of gut mucosa where massive destruction of immune cells is occurring gutassociated lymphoid tissue accounts for of the bodys immune system restoring its function is crucial to ridding the body of the virus hiv cannot be cured but the drugs known as highly active antiretroviral therapy or haart can keep the virus under control at first doctors had hoped that years of treatment might eventually eradicate the virus but years on from the advent of aids it is clear that cannot happen that is because the virus can hide out quietly in reservoirs which include certain immune cells the gut is clearly important too dandekars team says we found a substantial delay in the time that it takes to restore the gut mucosal immune system in those with chronic infections dandekar says in these patients the gut is acting as a viral reservoir that keeps us from ridding patients of the virus the mucosa are the wet tissues that line the nose and throat the genitals and the inside of the gut hiv often infects people via the mucosa longterm survivors dandekars team has been studying hivinfected patients who even without treatment have survived more than years with healthy immune systems including the tcells that the virus attacks we looked at their gut lymphoid tissue and did not see loss of tcells there this correlated with better clinical outcomes dandekar says so they started the current study following patients being treated with haart taking blood and gut samples before and after three years of treatment they found evidence of inflammation which disrupts tissue function promotes cell death and upsets the normal balance of gut bacteria dandekar say these findings suggest antiinflammatory drugs may help haart to work better the australian velvet worm euperipatoides rowelli is a living fossil that has been puzzling researchers for years the soft and elusive velvet worm might look like a pretty caterpillar but its brain is strikingly similar to that of a spider new international research shows the architecture of the worms brain has more in common with a spiders brain than with the brains of other arthropods researchers report in the journal proceedings of the royal society b biological sciences velvet worms have a body formation between that of a worm and an insect and for many years scientists believed they were the missing link between the two this view was supported not only by the way they look but also by the fact that they date back million years researchers including associate professor david rowell from the australian national university in canberra were interested in finding out whether this was true they found out that the worms are not a sister group of the arthropods but lie within the arthropods and share a common ancestry the team catalogued aspects of the microanatomy of various arthropod brains and then loaded the information into a computer program designed to sort out molecular lineages and create a family tree we found the worms did actually fall within the arthropods and are very similar to the chelicerates spiders and scorpions the brains of the velvet worms looked strikingly like spider brains rowell says thats interesting for a number of reasons firstly because its not something weve seen before and secondly because the worms dont carry many of the body characteristics of the chelicerates and yet their brain structure suggests that they are similar we can only assume that over time they lost a lot of the characters that identified them as chelicerates velvet worms or onychophorans are extremely rare and are only found along the east coast of australia tasmania new zealand south africa south america and along the tropics contrary to the way they look they are vicious carnivores that eat almost anything that moves rowell says they trap their prey by firing a sticky goo over them are we literally flushing away a potential source of extra drinking water by saying no to recycled sewage australians will oneday come to terms with the need to drink recycled sewage despite the recent decision of a queensland town to veto it experts say the residents of toowoomba voted in a weekend referendum against the plan to introduce treated sewage into the local water supply but advocates of recycling say rather than killing off the debate the no vote marks the opening shot in a new debate professor nick ashbolt head of civil and environmental engineering at the university of new south wales unsw says recycling sewage is inevitable given australias swelling population and looming water shortage basically its essential he says we dont have enough water to go around if you do the growth predictions of major cities based on current water usage wed be sucking our rivers dry and still not supplying enough water associate professor greg leslie of the unesco centre for membrane science and technology at unsw says if toowoomba residents had been given more information before the referendum they would have voted differently what we need to do is make sure that when the next vote comes along theres a more informed debate he says the next town that makes this decision would probably do it in a more enlightened environment rather than one that was dominated by the belief youll be drinking turds from your toilet the best drinking water in australia leslie says the proposed treatment would have given toowoomba residents the cleanest drinking water in the country the water that would come out of that plant at toowoomba had it been built would have been the best quality water in australia he says this is because it would have been more highly treated than normal drinking water under the toowoomba plan sewage would have passed through two membrane barriers including a micron microfilter and a reverse osmosis membrane reverse osmosis which is also used in desalination reduces the total organic carbon content from milligrams per litre to milligrams per litre he says after passing through the filters the water would then have been treated with a combination of uv light and peroxide to polish the water at a molecular level drinking water generally only passes through a sand or carbon filter and isnt subject to reverse osmosis he says while toowoomba has been portrayed as a national landmark leslie says residents of one new south wales town have been drinking treated sewage since he says people in richmond west of sydney drink treated sewage because the effluent is released into the hawkesbury river near the local water treatment plant which also draws its water from the river the level of treatment that the plant provides to the water before it puts it into the river is much less than they were proposing at toowoomba he says ashbolt says up to of the water that goes into the treatment plant is tertiary treated effluent or effluent that been treated to the standard level to allow it to be released into the environment the toowoomba plan would have involved of its water coming from highly treated effluent were already doing in sydney what they said they wouldnt do in toowoomba he says but professor don bursill retired former chief executive officer of the cooperative research centre for water quality and treatment says there will always be some risks when sewage is turned into drinking water he says the chance of some pathogens and chemicals slipping through even the most sophisticated filtering systems cant be ruled out bursill also says water workers would need to be specially trained and the regulatory system beefed up to cope with the new recycling technology im glad the community in toowoomba rejected it because i dont think were ready for it he says australia also needs to concentrate on using its existing water resources more efficiently before turning to solutions like recycling he says toowoombas vote came ahead of the pending release of draft guidelines into the use of recycled sewage being developed by the environment protection and heritage council and the national resource management ministerial councils the first half of the guidelines dealing with recycled sewage for nondrinking purposes is expected by september the second half which will deal with a range of issues including recycled drinking water is scheduled to be released for public consultation in the middle of next year project manager ian newbery says the documents dont recommend whether or not effluent recycling should be adopted as a source of drinking water but he says the issue was included in the guidelines in response to toowoomba when the guidelines were first mooted recycled drinking water wasnt actually on the priority list he says its because of the activity in toowoomba and other places that its actually now inserted it may be that once people get a handle on the risks involved and the treatment processes that you can go through there may be less angst about it scientists found this cyanobacteria in sandy and muddy marine sediments near broome western australia the oceans are teeming with to more types of bacteria than previously believed many of them unknown to science according to a new study using a new genetic mapping technique us dutch and spanish scientists say they found more than different types of microbe in a single litre of water from deep sites in the pacific and atlantic oceans these observations blow away all previous estimates of bacterial diversity in the ocean says lead author dr mitchell sogin of the marine biological laboratory at woods hole massachusetts he says past studies have suggested that one litre of water would contain to types of microbe the oldest form of life on the planet microbes make up more than of the total mass of life in the seas from bacteria to whales weve found or maybe times more diversity in sea water than anyone imagined was present he says the study is part of a global census of marine life and is published today in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences sogin says the findings suggest there might be more than million types of bacteria in the seas alone if youre interested in new frontiers things to discover all you have to do is go to the ocean sogin says until recent years estimates of the total number of species on earth were below a million the new findings suggest that a swimmer swallowing a mouthful of sea water may be consuming perhaps types of bacteria the report says that many of the types of bacteria found at the sample sites including a hydrothermal vent at a subsea volcano off oregon are present in very low numbers in what the researchers call a rare biosphere not only are they diverse from each other but they are very diverse from anything we have in the molecular database sogin says the variety could upset normal understanding of the makeup of life in the oceans and how it evolved one possibility is that some types of microbe are rare in some parts of the oceans but common in others challenging traditional views of the seas as a homogenous bacterial soup there might be a biogeography of microorganisms in the sea something that microbiologists have been debating for perhaps hundreds of years sogin says another possibility is that rare bacteria are tolerated in a habitat because they produce something perhaps an enzyme or vitamin that more common species need a sideeffect of tolerating scarce types of bacteria is that they might prove to be a reserve of spare parts to help ocean life rebound after some cataclysm such as a giant asteroid or an ice age sogin says some rare species for instance might have genes allowing them to thrive if large tracts of the oceans freeze bacteria can exchange genetic material relatively easily speeding adaptation and recovery of the total ocean population sogin says the variety of life might also benefit pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms if you have a business plan based on drugs from diverse microbes the study should be very encouraging he says the latest study provides more evidence that men like women have a biological clock the risk of a miscarriage appears to rise along with the fathers age regardless of how old the mother is researchers report their study looked at nearly women who were pregnant in the s and s the researchers found that the risk of miscarriage was greater when the father was age or older than when he was years old whats more age made a difference even for men in their s miscarriage risk was about three times greater when the man was years of age than if he were younger than these risks were all independent of the mothers age a wellknown factor in miscarriage the researchers report in the latest issue of the journal obstetrics gynecology the findings add to evidence showing that like women men have a biological clock although men continually produce new sperm and can father children late in life research shows that their fertility gradually declines starting at a relatively young age also as with women older fathers are more likely to have children with birth defects one recent study found that a mans ability to have a child fades after the age of similar to a womans fertility decline after age another confirmed that genetic abnormalities in sperm steadily become more common as men age why does it happen miscarriages particularly those in the first trimester often occur because of genetic anomalies in the foetus which may explain the risk tied to paternal age the current findings strengthen the belief that people planning a family should consider not only the womans age but the mans as well according to the study authors as childbearing is increasingly delayed in western societies this study provides important information for people who are planning their families write the researchers led by dr karine kleinhaus who was with the columbia university school of public health in new york at the time of the study back in the s and s the findings are based on data from a large study of women in jerusalem who were pregnant between and about of whom suffered a miscarriage these women were compared with the more than study participants who delivered a baby older paternal age was linked to a higher miscarriage risk regardless of both the womans age and a range of other factors that contribute to miscarriage such as smoking during pregnancy and maternal diabetes still the researchers point out despite this generally higher miscarriage rate older paternal age may only slightly raise the risk to any one couple jupiters great red spot with its smaller cousin red spot junior seen through a special filter that samples thermal radiation from deep in the cloud layer astronomers have taken images of jupiters lesser known red spot a smaller landmark called red spot junior the smaller spot is about as wide as earth and formed from the merger of three white spots sometime between and red spot junior only turned red in december astronomers say using the keck ii telescope on hawaiis mauna kea scientists from the university of california berkeley and the wm keck observatory captured a highresolution picture of both small and large red spots late in july both are located in the same area and appear to be racing each other around the planet the larger great red spot rotates westwards in the opposite direction to the planet the scientists say as alternating bands on the surface of jupiter move in opposite directions the nearby smaller spot moves eastwards the two spots are about the same colour when seen in visible light but red spot junior is much darker when viewed at infrared wavelengths the scientists say that difference could mean the smaller storms cloud tops are lower than the big storms astronomers have known about jupiters great red spot a highpressure storm on the big planets surface for centuries this better known spot is nearly twice its smaller companions size and has been circling jupiter for at least years genes that control head size are puzzling researchers who say they may also play a role outside the brain the genes that are thought to have helped humans evolve big brains dont appear to play any role in how intelligent we are according to a dna study this backs separate research that has failed to come up with a link between head size and intelligence except in extreme congenital abnormalities the queensland institute of medical research qmir study is the first to specifically look at genes head size and intelligence in a normal population the australian study found that people who scored highly in intelligence tests didnt necessarily possess versions of the genes that were expected to code for big heads and intelligence and people who did possess the suspected smart versions of the genes werent necessarily the most intelligent or the ones with the biggest brains the study will be presented at the th international congress of human genetics in brisbane next week head space the researchers tested teenagers for head size and intelligence they also looked at the genes aspm mcph and cdkrap which regulate brain size and activity when mutated these genes result in an abnormally small brain a condition known as congenital microcephaly normal variation in these genes has not yet been investigated in relation to head size and intelligence says dr michelle luciano a research fellow at qmir she says the only comparable previous study used mri imaging to measure brain volume in relation to two microcephaly genes their findings about a relation to brain size were negative and they didnt find a relationship with two of the genes we were looking at she says we decided to take it a step further and look at intelligence and lo and behold we find a similar negative result ancestral or evolved we all carry the three genes the qmir team investigated but some of us carry ancestral or less evolved versions and others carry derived or more recently evolved versions some of us carry one of each researchers had expected that people with evolved versions of the gene would be smarter and have bigger heads but were surprised to find this wasnt the case luciano says we would predict that if youve got the more recent version you should have a higher iq she says we actually found that not to be the case it is unlikely then that selective pressure for these genes is related to the evolution of intelligence in humans rather she says the genes might be important for a neurological function outside the brain are humans getting smarter professor colin groves an expert in human evolution from the australian national university says human brains began getting bigger after our earliest ancestors like homo habilis appeared but our brains have stopped growing and have actually started getting smaller or at least more compact our brains have got bigger but theyre not getting bigger he says in fact since the late pleistocene in general theyve got smaller while brain size appears to be related to intelligence between species this doesnt seem to be the case within a species groves says and despite the development of technological advances he says theres no evidence that homo sapiens has become more intelligent in the last years nacreous clouds seen as the fading light passes through tiny ice crystals blown along on strong jets of air rare motherofpearl coloured clouds caused by extreme weather conditions above antarctica are a possible indication of climate change australian scientists say known as nacreous clouds the spectacular formations showing delicate wisps of colours were photographed in the sky over an australian meteorological base at mawson station on july australian antarctic division scientist dr andrew klekociuk says such clouds are occasionally produced by air rising over arctic and antarctic mountains in high polar latitudes during winter you have to be in the right part of the world in winter and have the sun just below your horizon to see them he says nacreous clouds can only form in temperatures lower than degc australian bureau of meteorology officer renae baker says a weather balloon in the vicinity of the clouds in the stratosphere about kilometres above the earths surface measured temperatures as low as degc thats about as cold as the lowest temperatures ever recorded on the surface of the earth says baker who photographed the clouds klekociuk an atmospheric scientist says the rarely seen clouds also known as polar stratospheric clouds are more than just a curiosity they reveal extreme conditions in the atmosphere and promote chemical changes that lead to destruction of vital stratospheric ozone he says klekociuk says temperatures in the stratosphere between and kilometres above earth would be expected to drop as the planet warms data collected over the past years has reflected this he told abc radio over that time there has been a small decrease in temperature and that change is actually occurring faster than the warming at the surface of the earth he says the delicate cloud colours are created at sunset when fading light passes through tiny waterice crystals blown along on strong jets of stratospheric air winds at the same height were measured blowing at almost kilometres per hour the scientists say klekociuk says his colleagues and us researchers at the davis station kilometres to the east of mawson are working together on research into what the strange clouds reveal about the atmosphere humpback whales shed skin in the water which scientists scoop up in a kitchen sieve and analyse researchers may oneday be able to tell how old a whale is by looking for clues in its sloughedoff skin news of this noninvasive method which relies on examining the tips of chromosomes is published today in the journal nature scientists are interested in finding out the age of individual whales to assess the impact of decades of commercial whaling and to learn about mating tactics and behaviour some whales can be aged by studying their teeth but humpback whales dont have any so are aged by counting layers in their ear wax instead a procedure that can only be performed on a dead whale now researchers from the whale research centre at australias southern cross university are developing another method they trail behind the mammals in a boat they then use a kitchen sieve tied to the end of a stick to scoop up flakes of skin which can be the size of a hand the skin is shed naturally when the whales soar out of the water or slap their tails onto the surface the researchers believe they may be able to develop a system to work out a whales age by removing genetic material from the skin samples clues in the chromosomes they are studying the tips of chromosomes known as telomeres which whittle away over time in some animals like a countdown timer by measuring the length of these telomeres and comparing that with a known rate of shortening the researchers hope to estimate a whales age there are many hurdles to overcome researchers admit for instance noone knows for certain whether all whales have telomeres that shorten with time and not all skin flakes yield enough genetic material to analyse then the researchers have to calibrate their methods against whales of a known age but the nature report indicates that preliminary reports are encouraging if they are right one of the key arguments in favour of killing whales for scientific purposes will be dead in the water the report says the researchers say the need for humane methods to age whales is now urgent since japan has declared it will increase its annual catch of whales for research purposes the report says the international whaling commission imposed a moratorium on commercial whaling in but japan has continued hunting for what it calls scientific research scientists are analysing bone marrow from a frog that lived million years before this one the first fossilised bone marrow has been found in the bones of millionyearold frogs salamanders and tadpoles scientists say palaeontologist maria mcnamara says the find could tell us more about whether ancient creatures hibernated or whether they were coldor warmblooded mcnamara a researcher from university college dublin says her international team found the fossils in ancient lake deposits in the libros area of northeastern spain mcnamara says one of the most exciting aspects of the discovery is what the marrow will be able to tell scientists about creatures that lived during the later miocene period the original organic material is still there according to mcnamara whose research was published in the latest issue of the journal geology it is still organic in composition whereas most traces of soft tissues you find in the fossil record which are very rare anyway have rotted away and just the shape of the tissue is preserved in mineral she says tissue like bone marrow carries a lot of physiological information it can tell you the state of the organism when it died was it healthy did it hibernate where did it produce its red blood cells and whether it was warmblooded or coldblooded she says they would be pretty important to find for some other fossil groups like dinosaurs it could help to resolve some debate about whether they were warmblooded or coldblooded mcnamara says she says researchers are now doing tests to see if any biomolecules like amino acids or proteins are preserved mcnamara who is undertaking the research as part of work for a doctoral degree says there are a number of reasons why fossilised bone marrow has never been found before because bone marrow rots away so quickly when people die people never thought that it could be preserved she says also because you have to fracture the bones before you can see inside obviously if you have nice fossil specimens in a museum you are not going to get permission to break them up the researchers were able to access the marrow from the fossils because they were found in rock that had split and some of the bones had fractured as a result mcnamara says the original red and yellow colours of the marrow have been preserved the fatty bone marrow is yellow and is a sort of energy reserve in terms of starvation or something and you also have red bone marrow and that is where your blood cells are produced she says in the fossil bone marrow the original structure is preserved showing where the red and yellow marrow would have been but also the original colour is preserved and there are some cells preserved as well weather made the earth wobble on its axis like a wonky spinning top in a rarely recorded event scientists have confirmed that weather makes the planet wobble on its axis after exploiting a rare opportunity to detect and measure the most subtle shifts in the earths spin the wobbling at the poles was in the order of centimetres from the size of a cent piece to the size of a dvd says astronomer thomas johnson of the us naval observatory these loops are on the order of two or three days says johnson of the timeframe in which weather tugs and varies the direction earths axis is pointed in space to see the weather wobbles belgian researchers took advantage of an unusual period from november to february when two better known larger components in earths wobble cancelled each other out and no longer drowned out the signal of the smaller wobbles the two larger components are a day wobble thought to be caused by deep ocean current changes and annual wobble that corresponds to seasonal changes these change the position of the poles on about the scale of a baseball diamond says johnson every years they cancel each other out it was basically now or never says seacutebastien lambert of the royal observatory of belgium of their welltimed measurements which used gps data to ferret out the weather effects we would have to wait more than six years for another chance lambert and his colleague veacuteronique dehant publish their findings in the journal geophysical research letters lambert was also able to connect the specific wobbles seen during that period to atmospheric pressure systems over asia and europe this connection makes it possible to use weather forecasts to also forecast the smaller variations in earths wobble measuring these smaller wobbles is critical for navigational timing and communication systems says richard gross of nasas jet propulsion laboratory we have to know how the earths rotation is changing in order to track a spacecraft gross explains at distances of tens of millions of miles a few centimetres on earth can make the difference between communicating with the spacecraft and losing contact altogether its most important when you are trying to land something on another planet he says on earth the weather wobbles are also important because they can throw off models that are used to predict and correct for the larger wobbles multiplying errors in gps and military navigational systems the accuracy would be orders of magnitude worse without these wobble corrections says johnson at the latitude of reagan national airport near washington dc the variation could be the difference between a plane landing on the runway or hitting the potomac river the wobbles also have to be accounted for when finely tuning clocks and the timing of satellite communications they all require earth orientation data nowadays says johnson a gm corn that could soon be approved for human consumption in australia and new zealand might produce similar toxins to those of concern in cooked red meat say some scientists australia and new zealands food regulator is failing to apply its own safety standards or those of international guidelines in assessing a newgeneration gm corn for human consumption critics say but food standards australia new zealand fsanz defends its sofar favourable assessment of the highlysine corn which it says is intended for animal feed and is unlikely to enter the human food chain the centre for integrated research on biosafety at the university of canterbury has twice formally notified fsanz of its concerns about the gm corn ly which has been engineered to contain a bacterial gene that allows the accumulation of high levels of lysine among the types of potential hazards that this food poses are the creation of compounds that are known to be associated with important diseases like diabetes alzheimers heart disease and cancer says centre director associate professor jack heinemann heinemann says while the compounds advanced glycoxidation endproducts ages are also produced when cooking conventional foods he is concerned about potential levels in ly corn he says corn is normally extremely low in the compounds that combine to create ages but he says higherthannormal levels of lysine in the ly and high sugar levels combining under heat have the potential to raise age levels ly has the potential to produce times more ages than normal corn says heinemann draft approval by fsanz in march this year fsanz recommended ly be approved as safe for human consumption in a report to its board food derived from corn line ly is as safe and wholesome as food derived from other corn varieties the report says but the necessary tests to prove the corn is safe for humans have not been done says heinemann a geneticist and former us national institutes of health scientist he says ly is the first of a newgeneration of gm foods being specifically designed to be nutritionally different from their conventional counterpart and fsanzs decision could set a precedent on how such foods are assessed tests of cooked corn heinemann says fsanz only considered safety tests that looked at raw and not cooked corn but the international standardssetting body codex alimentarius recommends heating cooking and processing conditions be applied to gm material in an assessment of their safety for human food says heinemann he also says fsanz only considered day animal studies and not longer ones which might have picked up diseases like cancer heinemann says fsanz should also look into human feeding studies lastly heinemann criticises fsanzs decision to compare the composition of the corn to another gm corn rather than its nongm parent variety as recommended by its own advice and by codex safety assessment defended fsanz says testing was adequate we are satisfied that we have all the scientific information necessary to make a sound decision on the safety and nutritional adequacy of high lysine corn ly it says we have considered the potential for production of ages but have no concerns fsanz says codex only asks regulators to consider testing heated or processed gm foods but as the raw corn has much lower levels of lysine compared to other foods regularly consumed fsanz did not consider the tests necessary it also says the gm corn used for comparison was a better comparator than the nongm parental line fsanz says it assessed the corn as if it was any other gm food the safety assessment conducted on ly is as rigorous and thorough as for any gm food product and assumes that if approved corn from line ly could be routinely entering the food supply and not present just as an occasional inadvertent ingredient states fsanzs report will it enter the human food supply fsanz also says the corn is unlikely to end up in human food and is only being assessed as a precaution in case of an accidental mixup one such mixup occurred in when starlink gm corn also intended for animal feed became mixed in the us food chain because it was not registered for human consumption the contamination affected exports and cost the manufacturer a million in lost sales canada approved the use of ly in the human food supply last month the fsanz board is due to consider the corn in late september could epsteinbarr virus be transmitted via sex as well as kissing sex may increase the odds of contracting the glandular fever virus a uk study suggests this means that doctors and patients may have to rethink what they currently call the kissing disease the findings would also have implications for the vaccines now being tested against epsteinbarr virus ebv which causes the disease the study into this common condition in young people also known as mononucleosis is published in the journal clinical infectious diseases of college students who were initially free of ebv nearly half became infected with the virus over the next three years with sexually active students being at greater risk students who said theyd had intercourse during the study were more likely to become infected than those who reported no romantic relationships as well as those whose relationships were limited to kissing and petting the findings suggest that sexual intercourse itself makes ebv transmission more likely according to the study authors led by dr dorothy crawford of the university of edinburgh most adults worldwide are infected with ebv which after first infecting a person remains dormant in the body for life most of the time the initial infection causes no apparent symptoms especially when its contracted in childhood but in developed countries infection often doesnt occur until adolescence or young adulthood when its more likely to make people sick glandular fever is marked by often prolonged fever fatigue sore throat and swollen lymph nodes according to crawfords team the new findings suggest that sexually active teens and adults may be exposed to a larger dose of ebv through particularly deep kissing or possibly through genital fluids which can carry the virus if a large viral load increases the odds of developing glandular fever the researchers note then an ebv vaccine may be successful even if it merely decreases the amount of ebv in the body rather than providing complete immunity we suggest that a vaccine that reduces the level of viral infection andor replication during primary infection could be sufficient to prevent glandular fever the researchers conclude the hawaiian islands have a rich cultural history as evidenced by these prehistoric etchings in lava rocks now archaeologists have discovered more about the rise and fall of civilisations on the island of maui an ancient temple system on the hawaiian island of maui is about years older than previously thought according to an extensive archaeological study the finding contradicts a prior theory that mauis temples were built within a span of just a few decades around the year some researchers now think the temples were built over the course of years with construction cycles peaking during periods of significant political change we see construction phases that parallel shifts in political control says associate professor michael kolb who led the study which has been accepted for publication in the journal current anthropology chiefs likely wanted to mark their territory whenever a new leader came into power he would probably seek to validate his new political and ideological ideas through modification or expansion of the temple system adds kolb a professor of anthropology at northern illinois university radiocarbon dating of charcoal from beneath the building foundations formed the basis of the new research the charcoal remains were left behind after ancient builders cleared vegetation with controlled fires usually archaeologists rely on dating of ceramics but ceramics did not exist in early hawaiian history there is not a lot of soil formation on the islands so the polynesians who settled on maui lacked clay and therefore pottery kolb says dating charcoal the charcoal dating determined that the pihana temple located in halekiipihana state park is mauis oldest temple according to the new data the existing ruins date to one of the islands bestknown temples is piilanihale heiau which means the house of piilani who was a popular chief it is mauis largest temple covering more area than a football field and standing metres in height piilanihale was dated to the scientists believe this initial th century building phase was followed by subsequent periods of construction in the th century and again during a particularly active phase near the turn of the th century kolb explains that although polynesians inhabited the hawaiian islands as early as the year their settlements were initially small spreading out over time ancient polynesians were once interested in ancestor worship and built small places of worship by paving off land and stacking rocks according to archaeological evidence from early shrines in hawaii and tahiti over time polynesian culture shifted toward sacrificial worship which led to the enormous platform temples some built on cliff faces or other prominent spots the most elaborate temples featured altars oracle towers offering pits palisades drum houses and god or ancestral images carved from wood or stone the shock value of these temples for religious ceremonies must have been tremendous says kolb at some events there would have been human sacrifice the killing of hundreds of pigs the sounds of music and drumming and the smell of burning fires members of the chiefly class were allowed into sacred areas of the temples but they had to get in prostrate positions or lie down sometimes for hours as a sign of submission and respect for the chief contact with westerners the first westerners arrived with british explorer captain james cook in when christianity was introduced to the islands in most of the temples were destroyed or abandoned maui has some of the best remains with more than remaining sites timothy earle a professor of anthropology at northwestern university agrees with the conclusions of the new study which he says involved the broadest set of carbon dates they appear to be good and valid both earle and kolb believe the new findings suggest early hawaiian monumental architecture was comparable to that of other famous ancient civilizations such as the maya or the early egyptians since all appeared to have linked temple construction to economic political and ritual development a robot army wont look like what we have come to expect from the movies a robot army could never be held morally responsible for committing war crimes says an australian ethicist and so any wars they fight could be considered unjust dr robert sparrow of monash university who specialises in the ethics of new technologies will lay out his argument in the journal of applied philosophy to fight a war properly you must always be able to identify somebody who is responsible for the deaths that ensue says sparrow who is also with the centre for applied philosophy and public ethics at the university of melbourne as this condition cannot be met in relation to deaths caused by an autonomous weapon system it would therefore be unethical to deploy such systems in warfare sparrows article was triggered by his discovery that the military is the largest funder of robotics research for example he says the us military is developing an army that places autonomous machines in key roles on the front line currently the army uses semiautonomous robots in mine clearing and bomb disposal and for any machine that kills people there is always a human being that can be held morally responsible says sparrow he says this applies for example to unmanned combat aerial vehicles that are programmed to help locate specific targets and fire on them currently used in the middle east conflict but asks sparrow what would happen if machines themselves were given the decision about who to kill autonomous killing machines having killer robots on the front line instead of young men and women may be more politically acceptable but will this mean any war crimes could be blamed on the machines asks sparrow radio tags have been used to track cattle for decades where a security glitch is hardly a matter of national security but how secure are the rfid tags in your passport hightech passports touted as advances in national security can be spied on remotely and their identifying radio signals cloned computers hackers were shown at a weekend conference radio frequency identification technology or rfid used in cash cards and passports can be copied blocked or imitated says melanie rieback a privacy researcher at vrije university in the netherlands hacked chips could be used to launch attacks on software in computers linked to scanning devices the doctorate student says rieback demonstrated a device she and colleagues built to hijack the rfid signals that manufacturers say cant be read by anything other than proprietary scanners the device is also designed to block scanners legitimate or illicit reading a tag the researchers expect to have a reliable portable version of their device finished in six months and have no plans to immediately massproduce these things a cheer rose from the legion of hackers in the conference room when rieback announced that the schematics and the computer codes for the device would be made public the industry and government needs to not be scared of us rieback says she says rfid equipment makers would be wise to ramp up encryption and other security if you are using rfid to track cows who cares rieback asks but with a passport it only takes one breach at the wrong time and it could wreck it for the rfid industry rfid tags consist of a computer chips wrapped with tiny radio antennas the chips store financial identity or other data that can then be sent to scanners by radio signals us retail behemoth walmart about two years ago embarked on a campaign to use rfid to track inventories and shipments from suppliers and the devices are used to track cargo in shipping containers rfid tags have been used for decades to track cattle or wild animals pet owners also have chips about the size of grains of rice implanted under the skin of their dogs or cats so they can be identified and returned if they run away the european central bank has talked of putting rfid technology in euro currency and such tags were used in world cup soccer tickets according to the researcher smart chips are being put into passports stores have experimented with using the tags not only to track inventory but to bill shoppers for purchases invisibly as they leave it has been creating quite a stir rieback says of rfid use a page from the archimedes palimpsest viewed by xray showing the hidden text ancient writings by the legendary greek mathematician archimedes have been revealed for the first time in years scientists at the stanford university linear accelerator center used an intense xray to reveal the text as part of an ongoing study of the famous scholars hidden work the writings were recently revealed as part of a live webcast which has been archived and can be viewed here were getting a vastly better understanding of one of the greatest minds of all times says uwe bergmann a scientist involved in the project we are also showing it is possible to read completely hidden texts in ancient documents without harming them bergmann adds the document in this case is the archimedes palimpsest a goatskin parchment upon which a scribe copied seven important treatises of the greek scholar who lived from bc the hidden text was part of a work archimedes called the method of mechanical theorems which proved to contain diagrams equations and previously unknown letters historians are surprised that the manuscript even exists someone may have rescued the original papyrus version when the royal library at alexandria which contained monumental works by scholars from the ancient world suffered a series of fires beginning around bc many scientists believe that if all of the works of early scientists and mathematicians had survived greater progress would have been possible during the renaissance as academics wouldnt have had to rediscover principles already documented it will take some time to determine exactly what the newly unveiled text means but the rest of the document contains some of the earliest known references to geometry physics and the concept of infinity which later contributed to the invention of calculus it also describes a puzzle game that was somewhat similar to rubiks cube in the th century greek monks recycled the parchment into a prayer book then th century forgers painted gold foil imagery onto the recycled pages in an effort to increase the manuscripts value as a result archimedes original text is buried beneath both the gold image and the prayers only the underside of the parchment hints at its original content the manuscripts owner who wishes to remain anonymous paid u million for the document at auction in two conservators recently brought the rare text to california for the xray scan to my knowledge this is the first time the stanford equipment will be used for such an application says mary miller a science producer at san franciscos exploratorium museum which hosted the event miller says that the hightech equipment is often used to study photosynthesis in leaves at the molecular level the powerful device is now tuned to read iron which was in the ancient scribes ink iron atoms have electrons orbiting around a nucleus the xray beam literally knocks out one of the electrons in the iron atoms innermost orbit another electron then replaces the missing one but it has less energy because the nuclear bond is not as tight the lost energy emitted by the replacement electrons results in the signature xray glow last years lockhart review recommended that australias ban on therapeutic cloning be lifted but the federal government has ruled out a conscience vote so where does that leave research the head of the uk genetics institute that produced the worlds first cloned human embryo has accused australia of damaging the international research effort by refusing to allow therapeutic cloning professor john burn medical director of the institute of human genetics at the university of newcastle upon tyne was commenting after prime minister john howard ruled out a conscience vote on whether therapeutic cloning should be allowed in australia its a cost to the international research effort because australias a very important component of it and its a shame that that positions been adopted says burn who is in brisbane for the th international congress on human genetics therapeutic cloning which involves the creation of an embryo for research and to harvest stem cells is distinct from reproductive cloning which results in a human being both practices are currently banned in australia although the independent lockhart review last year recommended the ban on therapeutic cloning should be scrapped burns unit received europes first cloning licence in and researchers announced the following year that they had created a cloned embryo by somatic cell nuclear transfer this year his team reported they had produced mice from sperm grown from embryonic stem cells a shadow over stem cell research but the uks cloning achievement was overshadowed by south korean professor woo suk hwang hwang had apparently beaten burns team by claiming just months before that this team had cloned human embryos and produced stem cell lines from them hwang later admitted fabricating that claim the scandal was a major setback for embryonic stem cell research burn says he says it damaged the credibility of the field and had made it harder for scientists to do their work because it had brought about increased regulation and requirements although we were very pleased to have actually been the first it did cast a huge shadow over the whole field and every paper submitted now has to be backed up with endless evidence he says prime minister john howard ruled out a conscience vote on therapeutic cloning over the weekend but says he is still happy to have a party room debate on the matter forcing a brain drain burn says the australian government is making an illinformed and too cautious decision not to adopt the recommendations of the lockhart review the decision will continue to force australias top scientists offshore he says clearly if people feel unable to work on a topic they will move he says he says the university of newcastle upon tyne has formed an alliance with melbournes monash university to work on embryonic stem cell research it may well be that by strategic alliance the australian scientists will find a way around the federal obstruction he says burn says the promise of stem cell research is absolutely undeniable i think if the prime minister approaches this in a democratic way then the vast majority of australians would want this research to go ahead he says and i think the vast majority of australians would say if its ok in britain we cant see why its not ok in australia canada geese fall sick when they eat designer grass laced with fungus designer strains of grass could one day be used to keep birds away from golf courses and airports new zealand scientists say research into these smart grasses is discussed this week at the agricultural biotechnology industry conference in melbourne chris pennell and his colleagues at ag research new zealand have been working on particular types of fungi that coexist with grass these fungi called endophytes live in the spaces between plant cells by choosing the right combination of endophyte and grass the researchers hope to produce turf with unique properties some endophytes repel insects and others are toxic to livestock that graze on them pennell says over the past two decades he and his colleagues have been working to find the right combinations of grass and fungus to offer the benefits without the toxic sideeffects weve been looking for the friendly endophytes pennell says of the research which has mostly been for the livestock industry more recently the researchers have also begun designing grass and fungus combinations to keep birds away insects cant eat these grasses which deprives some birds of their food source they can also give grasseating birds such as canada geese an illness the researchers call postingestion malaise when herbivorous birds eat this grass they get sick and then they dont come back again says richard curtis business development manager at ag research new zealand the idea is that for airports planting grass that keeps insects and birds away could help reduce dangerous birdstrikes where our feathered friends collide with aircraft in the past few months the team has planted test plots of the grasses at christchurch international airport the early results are promising curtis says of the research which the airport helped to fund it wont solve all the problems with birds around airports but itll be a part of the overall bird management armoury he says there is a lot of interest from airport companies around the world meanwhile the scientists are also applying the technology to golf courses where fouling from birds like canada geese can spoil a day on the greens early trials on new zealand golf courses shows that planting a metre strip of the smart grass around waterways keeps geese and other birds away curtis says they just packed up and went to other parts of the golf course is this an accurate representation of actor nicole kidman or is she fatter or thinner in real life these questions are the basis of new research into body image people who are unhappy with their own body are likely to think celebrities are thinner then they really are new australian research shows the study is more evidence that being dissatisfied with your body is likely to distort your perception of other peoples bodies lead researcher amy willinge who is undertaking a doctorate of clinical psychology at the university of sydney reports the findings online in the international journal of eating disorders she asked normal weight university students mostly aged to to study actual photographs of thin female celebrities and computeraltered images showing them as thinner or heavier participants chose the image they thought was the actual size of each celebrity and which they thought was the ideal size for a female the five underweight celebrities were nicole kidman kylie minogue holly valance angelina jolie and sarah jessica parker each had one fulllength photo of their true size and six others which were and thinner and heavier than reality displayed randomly on the same screen when trying to identify the actual photos bodydissatisfied males and females chose images that were significantly thinner than in reality they also chose an ideal size thinner than the celebritys real size people who were satisfied with their body were more realistic and accurate in judging celebrities actual sizes while bodysatisfied females picked ideals that were larger than the celebritys real size males viewed thin as the female ideal the research suggests that if people are not satisfied with their own body it may lead them to distort their perceptions of others bodies and forge unrealistic attitudes towards ideal body sizes setting themselves up for an increased risk of eating disorders low selfesteem and depression willinge says the finding that body satisfied and dissatisfied males identified a very thin body size as ideal for women indicates there is increasing pressure from society on women to be thin media presentation of thin female images is affecting males attitudes towards female bodies putting increasing pressure on females to obtain the idealised body image but she says the findings absolve the media of some blame as it is not just presentation of thin images that results in body dissatisfaction but the way bodydissatisfied people view images but its still not clear how this research relates to brain development in humans ultrasound disrupts the brain development of unborn mice us researchers say in a study that adds to growing evidence that too many scans could also affect human foetuses prolonged ultrasound scans of the brains of foetal mice interfered with a process known as neuronal migration in which neurones move from one place to another the team at yale university reports proper migration of neurones during development is essential for normal development of the cerebral cortex and its function says dr pasko rakic chair of the department of neurobiology at yale we have observed that a small but significant number of neurones in the mouse embryonic brain do not migrate to their proper positions in the cerebral cortex following prolonged and frequent exposure to ultrasound writing in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences rakics team says the findings do not necessarily mean that ultrasound of human foetuses is dangerous but the researchers say doctors and pregnant women should probably keep the scans to a minimum the pros and cons ultrasound scans give parents a peek at the unborn child and doctors a chance to see if there are any serious defects that might be corrected before or right at birth but several studies suggest that ultrasound may affect the developing brain not necessarily adversely for instance a study published in the lancet journal found that foetuses exposed to ultrasound in the womb were more likely to be lefthanded a separate study found a possible decrease in weight in newborns who were scanned while a third found delayed speech but another study showed that children who had received ultrasound exams before birth actually did better on language tests when they were older says dr verne caviness of massachusetts general hospital more study is clearly needed rakic says we do not have any evidence ourselves that ultrasound waves cause behavioural effects in mice or have any effect on the developing human brain he says therefore i want to emphasise that our study in mice does not mean that use of ultrasound on human foetuses for appropriate diagnostic and medical purposes should be abandoned on the contrary ultrasound has been shown to be very beneficial in the medical context rakic adds he says the study suggests that pregnant women should not get multiple ultrasound scans for fun or out of curiosity the mouse study for their study rakic and colleagues did scans of pregnant mice on the th day of gestation this is the last week of gestation and a time when in mice neurones move to a new position in the brain after prolonged multiple scans some of these cells went to the wrong place does this study indicate that we should be concerned about human foetal ultrasound caviness asks in a commentary published in the same journal he says the implications are not known and notes a human foetus has a much larger and denser brain and that scans usually just pass over the brain for a few seconds the corresponding neurones in the human brain would probably be formed in the th week and continue to migrate for at least weeks caviness writes no one knows how sound waves might disturb a developing foetus or embryo both caviness and rakic say the project aims to collect dna and other health information from million volunteers researchers plan to collect blood samples and health information from every living member in western australia over the next few years in a move they say will create the worlds biggest human genetic databank professor lyle palmer from the university of western australia centre for medical research is leading the team that will hopefully collect samples from million volunteers next year the scientists hope to collect some pieces of information per person from the first people palmer told the th international congress of human genetics congress in brisbane it will be the first step in the proposed western australia genome health project one of a number of socalled biobanks that are being established around the world palmer estimates such a project would cost several hundred million dollars and the team will be seeking support from the federal government along the way the obvious thing to do is to study the whole population he says well be doing things like full body scans on everyone full respiratory and cardiovascular workups well be taking pictures of everyones retina doing hearing assessments well be scanning thousands of brains its about three days of data collection on each person some of which will happen at schools some at home some at central facilities everyone including children will be asked to participate palmer says data will also be collected from indigenous australians although this will be done under a separate umbrella with indigenous input the perfect population palmer says western australia is well suited to this kind of study because its an isolated yet outbred population with a relatively low migration rate and historically large families it also has extensive existing records much of the necessary infrastructure including the western australian dna bank and what he says is the biggest linked health database in the world palmer says the rising incidence of chronic disease together with an increasingly unsustainable health system and the growth of new tools and technology has made the project not only possible but necessary he says national privacy legislation and beefed up genetic data protection laws in line with the recommendation of the australian law reform commissions essentially yours report will ensure privacy is safeguarded youre asking people to donate their sample for ever and ever so of course you have to very carefully work through those issues and thats what were doing at the moment he says however information will be linked to individuals via a code to ensure they can be followed up he says pressure to have predictive genetic testing is coming from a surprising source a new study shows people are coming under more pressure from family members than doctors and even insurance agencies to have genetic tests an australian study reveals the findings are contained in the final report of the community component of the longawaited genetic discrimination project which was presented at the th international congress of human genetics in brisbane today chief investigator associate professor sandra taylor of central queensland university told the conference that of respondents reported feeling as if their family had forced them to undergo predictive genetic testing the type that gauges a persons chance of developing a disease we asked people had they experienced coercion or felt coercion in terms of undertaking testing and most respondents answered no they had not she says when reported however the category most frequently reported was within the context of the family itself follow by doctors genetic clinicians researchers and insurers but she says family pressure doesnt necessarily refer to coercive events but rather peoples perceptions of whats expected of them so in the family context people may feel coerced just because they want to help establish the risks of other people in the family without necessarily other family members applying pressure discrimination the study surveyed adults who had tests for inherited conditions including neurological conditions cancer and the blood disorder haemochromatosis between and a total of or of the respondents reported one or more incidents of discrimination of those that had experienced discrimination most said they experienced negative treatment by life insurers and bosses some felt family and personal relationships were adversely affected and others felt discriminated against by healthcare providers the report also found that most people either didnt know where to go to complain about negative treatment or didnt want to citing red tape and concern about consequences we would think that theres a need for increased education about consumers rights regarding seeking review or making complaints about negative treatment taylor says however people also said there were considerable benefits from having a test genetic tests in the workplace meanwhile a separate section of the report looking at discrimination by employers and life insurance agencies found that in of the cases investigated between and insurance companies had acted reasonably there were only three cases of apparently unreasonable insurance underwriting relating to people who tested positive to the breast cancer genes brca and brca the first national study of its kind the thirdparty survey also found negligible evidence that genetic tests were being used by the employers surveyed none had asked for a genetic test to be done and only one employer had asked for a previous test however there is strong potential for the use of genetic test information to increase in future investigator professor margaret otlowski of the university of tasmania told the conference in order for consumers to feel confident about that future clear guidelines must be in place she says carp make up to of fish biomass in some australian rivers putting pressure on native fish australian carp may have originated from germany according to preliminary results from a genetic study the researchers say their findings from the largest and technically sophisticated genetic study of carp in australia is also beginning to shed light on what caused them to become the cane toads of the countrys rivers university of sydney phd student gwilym haynes has been working with the new south wales department of primary industries and csiro to sample carp from every major river in the murraydarling basin as well as coastal rivers and from japan russia and germany by analysing nuclear and mitochondrial dna hes tracing the history of the freshwater pests invasion the preliminary results were presented at the th congress of human genetics in brisbane this week the australian carp cluster to the german carp which indicates they have mostly german ancestry he says boolarra carp carp cyprinus carpio were first introduced to southeastern australia in the late s but didnt become a problem until a fish farmer released a particularly robust strain in the town of boolarra in victoria in the early s haynes research suggests the boolarra strain bred with existing koi or japanese carp from earlier releases and began their colonisation of the southeastern waterways the study could also resolve the question of whether the boolarra strain was illegally imported or obtained locally from a population in the prospect reservoir in new south wales the official story is that they came from prospect but other people say they were imported from europe haynes says it does look like the strain which is supposedly responsible for the carp being so widespread was european and didnt need a lot of input from the asian carp to do well it implies that the carp were probably well adapted when they got to australia and didnt need to breed with the other australians to do well almost everywhere carp are currently established in every australian state and territory except the northern territory they pose a serious problem in australian waterways where they can make up to of fish biomass in the rivers putting pressure on native fish haynes says carp are likely to remain a pest and will certainly establish themselves in new regions understanding their genetics will make them easier to control he says there is significant genetic differentiation within regions in australia and this has implications for carp management he says these regions should probably be managed separately to get the best result forget mars this month say astromomers look for jupiter instead a repeat of last years spoof email promising that mars will look as large as the moon later this month is causing headaches for astronomers and science educators they say that the mars hoax appears to be just as resilient as the moon hoax which denies the moon landings ever happened for instance jennie mccormick education officer at aucklands stardome observatory says stardome like many other astronomy education centres has been fielding numerous calls for the past fortnight from people wanting more information about the bogus event the email originally dates from the opposition of mars when the red planet was very bright and spectacular because it was closer to earth than it had been for about years she says but it certainly didnt and couldnt look as big as the moon you need to read the email carefully to notice that mars would only look as big as the moon through a telescope which had magnified it times she says that mars does vary in brightness as its distance from earth changes but without a telescope it will never look much bigger than an ordinary star contrary to the email this month mars will be very low in the sky and only just visible in the west after sunset teachers have also been fooled by the hoax weve had several calls from children whose homework has been to find out what planet is going to be bigger than ever before says mccormick the hardest thing is having to disappoint children who are clearly excited by what they think they are going to see that is the sort of thing that turns them off science when astronomy is something that usually turns them on to it however she takes the opportunity to tell them although mars may be disappointing this month the giant planet jupiter is well placed for observing its actually much more spectacular than mars because it is bright and easy for them to find and with good binoculars they can see the planet with four of its moons she says mccormick also tells them to check out the bad astronomy website which uses science to debunk hoaxes like this not everyone is as concerned as mccormick about the mars email like alan macrobert a senior editor of sky telescope magazine i see it as a good thing not a bad thing its an immunisation if you make a fool of yourself by sending it to your friends and family youll be less likely to send them the next email chain letter you get which may not be so harmless he says is the culture that produced this wood carving predisposed to violence a new genetic study says yes but how much do social issues explain the crime statistics a new zealand scientist says the countrys indigenous maori people have a warrior gene which makes them more prone to violent and criminal behaviour dr rod lea revealed his theory this week at the th international congress of human genetics in brisbane australia acknowledging that it is controversial to suggest an ethnic group is predisposed towards criminal behaviour maori leaders immediately panned his claims maori party coleader tariana turia told the press newspaper that while she had heard of maori having a genetic predisposition towards alcoholism it was a big leap to include violent tendencies i realise that violence is an issue to us but there are very common factors as well with violence which are not really related to race lea a genetic epidemiologist at the institute of environmental science and research in wellington says that maori men have an overrepresentation of monoamine oxidase dubbed the warrior gene which is associated with aggressive behaviour the gene was discovered by us researchers but has never been linked to an ethnic group he told new zealands national radio that the gene appeared to feature in about of maori men compared with men of european descent i believe this gene has an influence on behaviour of humans in general but i also believe that the influence is rather small he says we have to be clear that behavioural traits such as susceptibility to addiction aggressive behaviour risk taking all those sort of things are extremely complex and they are due to numerous factors including nongenetic environmental factors like upbringing and other lifestyle factors lea says the gene explains some of the issues involving maori they are going to be more aggressive and violent and more likely to get involved in risktaking behaviour like gambling he says although he believes other nongenetic factors might also be at play there are lots of lifestyle upbringingrelated exposures that could be relevant here so obviously the gene wont automatically make you a criminal maori mp hone harawira believes social issues including high unemployment poor educational achievement and in many cases severe poverty to be the main contributors to maori violence rather than a warrior gene if you put any group in that situation i dare you to point at the group that wouldnt be aggressive as a result of being treated that way national urban maori authority chief executive john tamihere says he is open to researchbased evidence on whether there is a genetic reason for the overrepresentation of maori in violence statistics the chromosomes we have today may not be the ones well have in million years so what will this mean for the future of our species the pending demise of the y chromosome could give rise to a whole new species of human a professor of comparative genomics says scientists have been speculating about the demise of the y chromosome for some years now but professor jenny graves of the australian national university in canberra has come up with a bold new twist on the theory graves who has been working on sex chromosomes in marsupials will present her theory at the th international congress of genetics in brisbane today she will tell the conference that new male making genes on other chromosomes could step up to do the job of the y chromosomes sry gene which is the key to making males male but this could mean men without y chromosomes would split off from those with eventually evolving into a new species of hominid its quite possible that you could make new hominid species that way she says when two populations become two species graves says men without a y chromosome would be largely infertile but a small number would reproduce and pass the new sex determining gene to their children eventually the group with the new gene would separate from the y gene group potentially evolving into a new species she says the two groups couldnt mate with each other so theyd get gradually different just like chimpanzees and humans gradually became different million years ago she says when two populations become two species theres generally theres some sort of wedge driven between them so they cant mate with each other it might be a mountain range but it might be something fundamental like the way they determine sex has flipped to some new way million years and counting graves says there are only working genes left on the y chromosome from a grand total of it also contains a lot of pseudo genes which look like they should work but dont suggesting theyve recently become defunct according to her projections the y chromosome will disappear altogether in million years this will occur because unlike the other coupled genes the single y chromosome cant recombine with a matching partner and is less able to refresh itself mutations will build up and the mutated genes will eventually drop off the chromosome because they no longer perform any useful function graves says this has already happened in the case of the mole vole an aggressive little rodent that appears male and is able to reproduce despite having lost its y chromosome xx men australian researcher professor andrew sinclair of murdoch childrens research institute is researching socalled xx men or the roughly one in men who are born without a y chromosome what its pointing to is the presence of new genes we havent yet discovered to replace the ones on the y chromosome sinclair says alternately the volume of previously existing genes may have been turned up in the absence of the y genes he says sinclairs team is the first in the world to use new highdensity gene chips to examine xx men in the hope of finding out which genes these are about of affected men also have a tiny portion of the y chromosome stuck on their x chromosome which carries across the testis determining gene he says sinclair says graves theory about a new human species could make sense in a theoretical way but is unlikely in reality i dont know about a whole new species of human but if you lost the y chromosome completely males would have to evolve in some way to deal with it he says if you have males without a y chromosome i dont think id go as far as calling them a new species but a new type of individual the study relied on over ice cores collected from a range of locations around antarctica a new study that shows antarctic snowfalls have changed little in years despite global warming could be evidence that the worst is yet to come says one of the authors a study published today in the journal science reports that contrary to expectations snowfall in antarctica has not increased over the past years this contradicts the predictions of most climate models that are based on the assumption that warming air can carry more moisture and produce greater snowfalls at the poles the models predict that antarctic snowfall should be increasing with a warming atmosphere says australian team member and palaeoclimatologist dr ian goodwin of the university of newcastle goodwin doesnt challenge this basic climate physics but says the recent evidence supports the idea not recognised in climate models that there is a lag between global warming and antarcticas response to it the reason is that antarctica and the southern hemisphere are surrounded by large oceans that take a long time to heat and therefore act as a buffer to climate change recent evidence suggests the lag time could be up to years says goodwin we can be relatively complacent about the effects of climate change in the southern hemisphere because we havent seen dramatic changes he says but the frightening thing i think is that we are not yet seeing the full impact of global warming in the southern hemisphere but its just around the corner natural cycles goodwin and colleagues published a study in that showed an increase in snowfall in east antarctica but the new study shows that since then the amount of snow falling in that area has decreased goodwin and colleagues used direct measurement of snowfall and more than ice cores to reconstruct annual snowfall over the past years he says the study demonstrates a previously unknown natural climate cycle affecting the whole of antarctica on one side of antarctica in some decades we see an increase in accumulation of snow and on the other side of antarctica we see a decrease and so it balances out to zero net gain he says goodwin says this variability is so great it could mask any changes due to global warming but he says it could only be a matter of time before the natural cycle becomes dwarfed by the changes brought about by global warming and this is where he says the lag time becomes important if we were to rewrite this paper in say years time the likelihood is that we will be actually be writing a paper that says significant change in antarctic snowfall over the last to years says goodwin in all likelihood were about to see in the next couple of decades a very large response to global warming in antarctic and southern ocean regions goodwin says that the new research should now feed into climate models and make them more accurate embryo of the penis worm markuelia showing the embryo as a whole top and the part of the embryo that would have developed into the digestive tract bottom the first d images of the dawn of life have been made possible using a new technique allowing virtual dissections of halfbillion year old fossil embryos scientists say the images including those of ancient penis worm embryos are published today in the journal nature among the images were those of fossils from the genus markuelia found in china and siberia which date from the cambrian period the new imaging method reveals a universe of detail impossible using previous methods from the first splitting of cells to just before hatching the researchers including those from the uks university of bristol say their technique pushes back the frontiers of science much as the scanning electron microscope did half a century ago we are looking at the dawn of life says lead researcher dr phil donoghue because of their tiny size and precarious preservation embryos are the rarest of all fossils but these fossils are the most precious of all because they contain information about the evolutionary changes that have occurred in embryos over the past million years until now if scientists had wanted to study fossil embryos they had to look at them from the outside or cut narrow slices of the embryos which obviously destroys them but this new method known as synchrotonradiation xray tomographic microscopy or srxtm leaves the tiny fossils untouched yet gives graphic details of their structure accelerating particles the researchers used a metre wide particle accelerator in switzerland to deepscan the minute fossils they then fed the information into a computer to generate complete d images of the internal structures in fine detail the best analogy is with a medical ct scan but at times the resolution donoghue says we can see details less than th of a millimetre in dimension we can look at any and every part of the fossil inside and out without harming it and then virtually dissect it however we like the team says its discovery could roll back the evolutionary history of arthropods like insects and spiders in one case they had found hitherto hidden details of the interior structure of an ancient relative of the living penis worm and in another they had seen embryonic worm segments unlike those found in living specimens today the new study supports the idea that an infectious cell line is threatening to wipe out the tasmanian devil dogs can catch cancer by having sex with infected dogs or perhaps by licking biting or sniffing them uk researchers show the evidence for infectious tumour cells lends weight to a new form of cancer transmission which some researchers believe is how tasmanian devils catch their deadly facial tumour dr claudio murgia of university college london and colleagues report their findings in the current issue of the journal cell the researchers studied unrelated dogs worldwide with the canine transmissible venereal tumour ctvt also known as stickers sarcoma they found that the dna sequences isolated from tumour and blood samples were different we saw the tumour cells didnt belong to the dogs murgia says instead the team says the tumours from the dogs were closely related and had all come from single cancer cell that had evolved into a parasitic form this had been passed on from dog to dog through sexual contact and possibly through licking biting and sniffing tumouraffected areas murgia and colleagues say the cancer arose at least and possibly years ago in either a wolf or a closely related ancient dog breed making it the oldest cancer known to science tasmanian devil tumour earlier this year australian cytogeneticist annemaree pearse of tasmanias department of primary industries and water and colleagues reported preliminary evidence to support their theory that an infectious cancer cell line was responsible for the debilitating facial tumour killing endangered tasmanian devils pearse found that the chromosomes in the cancer were so complex they must have taken a long time to evolve she found the same chromosome types in tumours from both males and females and she found a devil that was born with a chromosomal abnormality did not have that abnormality in its tumour cells theres no other explanation for my results pearse says it shows absolutely that it is the cell itself that is being transmitted from animal to animal she says it is the cell thats the parasite position of the sun at different times of day as depicted in monets houses of parliament claude monets renditions of foggy london could be the earliest coloured record of the notorious pea souper smog that wrapped the british capital at the turn of the th century according to a scientific analysis of the artists london series the study published in the current issue of the proceedings of the royal society a show that monets paintings of the house of parliament were not created from his imagination on the contrary they were firmly based on actual observations made during the artists visits to london a founder of impressionism monet made three trips to the city between and producing hundreds of paintings showing the sun struggling to filter through the mist and smoke of victorian london the paintings depict the most famous global meteorological phenomenon of the th and th centuries the paintings show three views of central london engulfed by fog two southward views are from the savoy hotel where the french artist had a room and one westward view is of the house of parliament taken from st thomas hospital among the paintings of the series still existing only are dated between and a total of are dated between and and are undated this has suggested that monet dated his works to the time they were completed or sold when he had already returned from london to his home at giverny in normandy northern france there is some uncertainty as to whether the paintings are reasonably accurate depictions of observations one of the tenets of impressionism or whether the final paintings were rather creations of monets imagination in his studio in giverny says dr jacob baker of the university of birmingham wheres the sun to establish whether monets paintings are a fair rendering of what he observed baker and his colleague dr john thornes from the school of geography earth and environmental sciences analysed the position of the sun in nine of monets paintings showing the houses of parliament the researchers turned to astronomical data from the us naval observatory to trace the suns position over parliament during the artists stay in london they compared this data to the position of the sun in the paintings along with information in monets letters to his wife the results revealed that monet painted his parliament pictures all in the afternoon between february and march further calculations made it possible to discover the exact spot from which the french artist painted the pictures a second floor covered terrace of the former governors hall at st thomas hospital we are confident that these paintings show an accurate visual record of the urban atmosphere of victorian london thornes says great fog londons great fogs reached a peak in the late s then gradually declined but little is known about the nature and causes of the phenomenon due to the absence of air quality monitoring at the time the victorian fogs tended to be associated with industry employment and wealth to the minds of londoners at that time air quality and healthrelated issues tended to be neglected baker says baker and thornes are now planning further detective work on monets colours to determine the size density and composition of victorian fog particles the invasive red corals are crowding out the native cream ones polluted water helps exotic species to invade marine areas an australian scientist has found these exotics can become tolerant to metals like copper which gives them a selective advantage over native species marine ecologist dr emma johnston of the university of new south wales presented her teams research at the recent australian marine sciences association conference in cairns scientists know that ships inadvertently transport marine organisms all over the world allowing a relatively small number of weedy exotic species to crowd out more diverse communities of native species theres a problem with the homogenisation of the worlds biota where places such as harbours and bays are becoming more and more similar to each other says johnston but what helps these alien species to take root in their new found home what evolutionary advantage do they have over the natives studying polluted waters around sydney johnston and team have found that exotic invaders like the notorious red bryozoans lace corals thrive in copperpolluted water weve now got the first data that some of these introduced species are really highly tolerant of copper says johnston copper pollutes waterways from urban and industrial runoff mining activity and sewage but interestingly copper is also the main component of antifouling paints that are on the bottom of ships and johnston says this is acting as a selective pressure to deliver tough pollutionadapted exotics around the world this is because creatures that survive the antifouling paint have an advantage over the natives copper is the key in laboratory experiments johnston and team showed that exotic species from polluted waters are more tolerant of copper than native species but the same exotic species living in nonpolluted sites dont have the copper tolerance says johnston they seem to be able to switch the tolerance on and off she says adding that the findings apply worldwide johnston is now teaming up with the australian antarctic division aad to study the effect of pollution from antarctic bases on marine organisms in cleaning up pollution from previous lessenvironmentally conscious days the aad has found contaminated sediments says johnston separately she says the scientists have been looking at potentially invasive species and have studied alien species taken from on the hull of the aurora australis research vessel lab experiments have shown that up to seven of these species can survive down to c says johnston she now wants to see if these species are invading polluted sites in antarctica bombmaking ingredients could be hidden in small bottles and carried on planes alternatively toiletries themselves could be used to make explosives hair gels and lotions may have been banned from carryon luggage as they could be assembled on board a plane to make a bomb a us criminologist says professor alfred blumstein from carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh who helped write a government report on threats to airlines from explosives was speaking after uk police say they had foiled a plot to blow up aircraft flying to the us this prompted authorities to ban liquids including drinks hair gels and lotions from carryon baggage my hunch is that the reason they are prohibiting this stuff is that it does obviously have the potential of being assembled on board so that it doesnt look like a bomb going through the xray machine says blumstein such mundane items as nail polish remover disinfectants and hair colouring contain chemicals that can be combined to make an explosion and are not detectable by sniffing machines which detect plastic explosives but are not used with all baggage explosive ingredients can be concealed in bottles or other innocentlooking containers that would pass through xray machines that does not mean they are easy to make into bombs cautioned dr neal langerman a san diego consultant who is former chair of the american chemical societys division of chemical health and safety many of the ingredients like acetone are household chemicals langerman says but some kind of expertise is usually needed to buy peroxide that is concentrated enough to work in an explosive he says bombers who attacked london underground trains and a bus in july used homemade peroxidebased explosives carried in backpacks onboard explosives people have tried several times to use such easily concealed explosives on aircraft ukborn richard reid was tackled by passengers in december while trying to detonate explosives stuffed in his shoes in an aircraft lavatory in islamic fundamentalists set off liquid explosives on a japanbound philippine airlines plane killing a japanese passenger and injuring others dr mark ensalaco an international terrorism expert at the university of dayton in ohio says thursdays foiled operation appears to be identical to the japan attack i stress identical with the explosives in liquids which appear to be assembled on the plane ensalaco says can technology solve airport security issues or is a permanent ban on hand luggage the answer new technology to screen passengers and hand luggage for explosives is needed say analysts after last weeks airport security alert quite frankly metal detectors and xray dont cut it says chris yates aviation security expert at janes information group we need to invest we need to get money into the checkpoint we need to reassess how we do it perhaps this is the final wakeup call to actually shake the decision makers from their lethargy current airport security typically involves a fivelayered process of screening checkedin luggage with multiple xrays and ct scans that is too unwieldy and timeconsuming to apply to passengers and their hand luggage instead travellers pass through a metal detector gateway and their bags through an xray machine with a random sample also checked for explosives residue using trace particle detectors what would it take to be able to check all passengers and bags for explosives its something which i would imagine could only be solved with either sniffer dogs or electronic sniffers and hand searching its a very significant undertaking to do that at somewhere like heathrow airport says david claridge managing director of janusian security risk management in london janes analyst yates says new technology is becoming available such as quadrupole resonance scanning developed by australianbased qr sciences which uses radio waves to stimulate certain atoms such as nitrogen present in explosives its scanner with a trafficlight display to indicate allclear further investigation or danger has already been trialled internationally including at manchester airport rolling out such technology universally would require time and a huge reallocation of investment which until now has gone into other areas such as deployment of sky marshals on planes liquid explosives an al qaeda plot to blow up airliners with liquid explosives was uncovered as far back as but authorities have never previously banned people from carrying fluids such as toiletries onto planes as happened last week though police have given no further details security analysts say there were indications they were concerned about militants setting off a liquid explosive such as nitroglycerine with some form of nonmetal detonator or combining otherwise harmless liquids on board a plane to produce an explosive mix the future of hand luggage in the meantime yates says he expects the current restrictions on hand baggage to continue at least for flights into and out of the uk possibly for months he says a permanent ban on hand luggage would be untenable not least because of the risk of theft from luggage carousels but not everyone rules out such radical solutions i reckon the days of carryon luggage are gone says maxim worcester managing director of control risks consultancy in germany its the easiest way of solving the problem isnt it is this embryo destined to develop into a woman with breast cancer image istockphoto australian ivf clinics are offering a test that enables parents to discard embryos that will develop into women at risk of breast cancer the tests pick up mutations in the brca and brca genes dr leeanda wilton head of the genetic and molecular research lab at melbourne ivf told a recent international conference in brisbane but the tests have sparked ethical concerns about whether an embryo should be destroyed on the basis of a risk factor most current tests on embryos are based on detecting those that carry a known genetic disease pgd or preimplantation genetic diagnosis enables genetic abnormalities to be diagnosed in a very early ivf embryo before it is implanted into the mother originally tests used fluorescent in situ hybridisation fish to determine an embryos gender and detect whole chromosome disorders that may have made an ivf embryo unlikely to take once implanted but newer polymerase chain reaction pcr techniques have made it possible to test for a range of singlegene disorders such as cystic fibrosis haemophilia and muscular dystrophy this technique can also detect mutations in the brca genes which confer an estimated risk of the carrier developing breast cancer by the age of how is pgd done a woman with a family history of breast cancer or who carries the brca mutation can ensure her baby doesnt inherit it by undergoing ivf to create an embryo and testing that embryo before implantation to do this scientists make a tiny hole into the shell around the embryo gently remove one cell and test it if a mutation is found the embryo is discarded if no mutations are picked up it is implanted in the woman to establish a pregnancy while at least three australian clinics offer the breast cancer tests demand doesnt yet seem to be high although experts expect this to change dr wilton says melbourne ivf has the technology to test for the breast cancer mutation but hasnt yet done such tests thats predominantly because we havent been asked to do it she says dr david cram director of molecular genetic services at another large victorian clinic monash ivf says two patients have requested brca screening in the two or three years its been available he expects demand to grow as more young women of childbearing age find they carry the gene once systems are in place to identify these mutations more readily women of a younger age will consider this option when they want to have children he says i think well see some patients take up the technology in the future james marshall pgd laboratory manager at sydney ivf says about three patients have asked for testing and a number clinical geneticists have inquired about it the first patient requests have only been in the last nine months he says queensland fertility group hopes to be able to test for a range of singlegene conditions probably including breast cancer by the end of the year says scientific director keith harrison once youve got a monogenic pgd program then wed do all the tests as long as the gene defect is characterised he says but it would be an interesting one to run past the ethics committee because when youre testing for say cystic fibrosis or huntingtons youre discarding or destroying embryos because they actually carry a moderately lethal defect but the brca gene isnt a total guarantee youre going to get the disease ethical concerns dr wilton acknowledges there are ethical issues in testing an embryo for breast cancer risk but defends a womans right to have the test its not straight forward ethically thats for sure but i think what we see is that the patients who come for pgd certainly dont do it on a whim she says usually the ones who end up in pgd have usually had a very tragic history of breast cancer if there is a way that her daughters can avoid that its very easy to understand why patients would want to take that path dr domenico coviello is an italian medical geneticist and head of the laboratory of medical genetics in milan coviello who raised concerns about the practice at the th international congress of human genetics earlier this month says pgd is banned by law in italy and other european countries including austria and germany medical geneticists and doctors in general have the aim to help people and cure people but i am a little concerned about taking tests especially on predisposition and brca is only a risk he says local maize left and introduced variety right from baucau east timors second largest city looting and security threats during recent civil unrest havent deterred an initiative thats helping east timorese farmers increase their crop yield the australian governmentfunded seeds of life sol program aims to improve crop yield and resistance to pests and disease through the use of improved varieties of five staple crops maize cassava sweet potato rice and peanuts early results have been encouraging staff say with a increase in grain yields on research station trials and on farmers fields months earlier civil unrest in the capital dili including the looting of the sol office by people queuing for rice threatened to slow the program but nothing stops the planting of crops says alex dalley the programs research and extension officer dalley says despite a number of timorese nationals working on the program losing family members in the violence and other staff members being forced to move from the capital due to threats and lack of security it is business as usual for the program were working full days and farming is carrying on in the districts due to the good geographic spread of the program all the staff have been able to continue their work in areas of the country which they feel comfortable in dalley says food insecurity is a major issue in east timor it affects an estimated of the population with many rural households experiencing food shortages from november to february food insecurity is partly the result of low levels of food production a consequence of poor land and the generally low levels of technology combined with high crop losses both pre and postharvest sols work is a mix of research training trialling with farmers setting up research stations and applying socialeconomic research these healthy mice were conceived using sperm from fathers that been sitting in the freezer for years sperm extracted from mice and testes that have been frozen for as long as years have yielded normal healthy offspring in a study that researchers say heralds fresh hopes for bringing back extinct species frozen sperm is now preserved with cryoprotectants substances that protect it from freezing damage but defrosted sperm cannot always fertilise an egg researchers from japan the uk and hawaii have now found that sperm can be frozen safely for much longer than previously thought so long as it is kept in organs or whole carcasses and cooled slowly to degc or lower they publish their findings online today in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences the scientists used sperm from whole mice and testes that had been frozen for between one week and years and managed to fertilise eggs via microinsemination to obtain healthy offspring many people thought that sperm integrity could be retained for several months at most but the sperm nucleus is stronger than we expected says dr atsuo ogura of the japanese governmentfunded riken bioresource centre sperm nucleus is good for at least years he says adding that offspring of the mouse that had been frozen for years did not appear any different from the others anyone can do it the scientists used very simple freezing methods the mouse that was frozen whole for years was merely kept in a conventional freezer at degc ogura says this cryopreservation technique is probably the simplest and anyone can do it liquid nitrogen is not necessary any conventional freezer or dry ice will work very well he says this method of freezing would work for many other mammals because mammalian sperm has special dna that retains nucleic activity and keeps the nucleus alive we can apply this method to many other mammals it is very simple just put the testes or dead body into a freezer but he cautions that carcasses must be allowed to cool slowly for about two to three hours to reach degc sperm frozen at lower temperatures would be better preserved degradation is minimal in liquid nitrogen degc molecules in the cells stay still in this condition so the degradation will be minimal he says hope for ivf extinct species the experiment may also have implications for freezing sperm for future cycles of ivf this experiment proves that immotile sperm is just as good if frozen in good condition ogura says looking ahead ogura says this advance gives fresh hopes that extinct species may roam the earth again restoration of extinct species could be possible if male individuals are found in permafrost he says through injecting the sperm into eggs from females of closely related species the new teddy is designed to recognise you respond if you cuddle it and tell medical staff if anythings wrong an electronic teddy bear inspired by therapeutic companion animals could offer hospital and nursing home patients a meaningful form of treatment without the worry of allergies bites or maintenance the huggable designed by researchers at the massachusetts institute of technology mit is based on a traditional stuffed animal but is actually much more it will be loaded with fullbody sensors motors microphones a video camera software and wireless communication technology to produce an engaging response to humans the bear is also designed to monitor the patient alert nearby nurses when the person may need help or more intensive longterm care and even gather information about the interaction that can be used to better understand the relationship later we are designing the huggable to be much more than a fun interactive robotic companion but rather to function as a team member that works with both the patient or resident and the hospital or nursing home staff with the ultimate goal of promoting the wellbeing of the person says walter dan stiehl a phd candidate at mit and the team leader for the project the first huggable prototype which stiehl and his team plan on finishing in the next few months will have more than sensors beneath the fur and a soft layer of silicone skin the temperature force and electric field sensors will work together to distinguish the presence of a human pick up some of the physiological signs of the patients condition and discern whether the person is petting scratching slapping or hugging the bear cameras in the eyes will be used to scan the room while face recognition technology in the robots computer will help the huggable detect familiar people microphones in the ears will allow it to hear and face the direction of a sound senses pain then acts on it stiehl and his team are programming the bear to exhibit different behaviours based on what it sees hears and senses if it sees someone familiar it can raise its eyebrows in an expressive greeting and say hello while being rocked it will wear an expression of happiness and when being cuddled it will nuzzle into the person but the concept for the huggable does not focus on simply providing companionship the technology will be designed to work with a separate computer located at a nurses station where video audio or other data collected by the bears sensors could alert caregivers in times of potential crisis for example if a patient is hugging the bear and then it falls to the floor that action could prompt a nurse to check that alls well longterm care the huggable can also collect information about the patientbear interaction over a long period of time any changes such as the patient suddenly becoming aggressive or showing far less activity may offer subtle indications of more serious problems weve not adequately used technology to help older people and this is one potential in which we could do that says rebecca johnson professor of aged care nursing at the university of missouri in columbia stiehls group is finalising the first prototype and hopes to have at least if not huggables available for pilot trials in about a years time the whale had enourmous eyes and unlike todays baleen whales teeth to rip apart prey a bizarre whale fossil found on a beach in southern australia suggests that baleen whales the filterfeeding gentle giants of the sea were not always gentle or giants a researcher says erich fitzgerald a phd student of monash university in melbourne and a research associate at museum victoria describes the million year old discovery in the latest issue of the journal proceedings of the royal society b the fossil which includes a complete skull of a whale and other bones was found in the late s by teenage surfer staumn hunder fitzgerald explains luckily for science he saw these dark brown slithers of fossilised bone protruding from a boulder on a beach near the town of jan juc in coastal victoria hunder and his father delivered the boulder to monash university more than six years ago but little longterm research was done on it until fitzgerald began studying it in even when id only completed half of it it was pretty obvious this was groundbreaking he says fitzgerald found that the fossil had specific features in the facial region and the base of the skull that marked it as a member of the baleen whale group which today includes the enormous blue whale but unlike modern baleen whales which eat by filtering tiny krill and plankton from water the fossil whale had teeth it also had enormous eyes this animal was capturing big single prey which is unusual for a baleen whale fitzgerald says it used the front of its mouth to grip its prey and rip it apart he says it was impossible to fit the fossil whale into existing branches of the evolutionary tree based on its shape size and characteristics for one thing it was only about metres long roughly the same size as a bottlenose dolphin the smallest living baleen whale the pygmy right whale is normally around metres long fitzgerald says this is something completely new this was an entirely new family which is a rare occurrence this new family of small highly predatory toothed baleen whales has been named in honour of the town of jan juc and its discoverer staumn hunder it is called janjucetus hunderi this essentially opens up a window on what the earliest baleen whales were like fitzgerald says it tells us that they were truly bizarre and living in ways completely unlike any baleen whales that have existed over the past million years you want me to do what people whose cheeks turn red at the thought of speaking to a stranger have similar blood flow to everyone else its just that their blushing takes longer to subside so its more obvious to them and others australian research suggests a team of researchers led by professor peter drummond from murdoch university in western australia rated facial blood flow in people frightened of blushing as they performed everyday but potentially squirmworthy tasks these included speaking to a stranger giving a speech and listening to the taped speech afterwards the researchers then compared the results with a group of people who werent frightened of blushing who performed the same tasks they found embarrassment and selfreported blushing intensity was greater in the fearofblushing group than in the control group throughout the experiment while increases in facial blood flow were similar in the two groups during each task blushing took longer to subside in the fearofblushing group than in controls the researchers report online in the journal behaviour research and therapy how this resulted in an incremental increase in facial blood flow over the course of the experiment drummond says the differences in blushing behaviour could come down to a number of factors it may be that there is a difference in the way the facial blood vessels respond during social encounters in fearful blushers which prolongs the increase in facial blood flow or a difference in the way people cope in slightly stressful situations he says or it may be that people who are frightened of blushing are simply more anxious than those who arent and this anxiety then persists for some time afterwards so it takes them a little longer to recover and get back to normal it may also be that because the blush response lingers longer theres more opportunity for the person and others to notice it he says what can you do about it either way drummond says the research has its silver lining for people worried about blushing during these social encounters they are blushing no more strongly or more frequently than people who dont feel they blush very much they just take longer to recover and that according to drummond could simply be the result of the blushers thought process theyre going over all the possible ways that they could have embarrassed themselves during the social encounter he says if the research helps people come to terms with that it could help them lose their fear of blushing he says the terrorism alert caused chaos at heathrow airport last week but could new security technology prevent a repeat performance no matter how sophisticated airport security technology becomes it will probably never remove the need for sniffer dogs and bag searches experts say the alleged foiled terrorist plot that affected flights between the uk and us last week has led to calls for newer smarter security technology devices on the horizon include insectbased sensors wallpaper that sniffs out explosives as you walk past and smart closedcircuit tv that can pick a suspect out from a crowd or tell if youve left a bomb under a seat but martin cebis whose company will present its allinone chemical sensing and surveillance system at an international military technology conference in the us next week says wouldbe terrorists will probably always be one step ahead of technology ultimately youre dealing with human ingenuity and youre fighting a moving target and need to be able to adapt says cebis chief executive officer of western australias embedded technologies i think youll still need searching and those kinds of things to occur cebis is also among a number of speakers who will brief security advisors and researchers in canberra on the latest developments today chemical sensing one of the emerging areas of security particularly in light of the alleged plot to carry liquid explosives onto planes is in chemical sensing associate professor adam mccluskey of the university of newcastle is an australian researcher developing chemical sensors based on drug design technology the sensors are can be screen printed onto fabrics paper plastics and even wallpaper its basically a synthetic antibody he says were applying drug design technology to generate polymeric scaffolds that specifically recognise the shape and electronics of the targeted molecule the technique has been used to identify cocaine and heroin and is being developed to pick up chemicals like tnt and triacetone triperoxide the chemical used in last years london underground bombings instead of metal detectors we would have a bank of these sensors sucking the vapours off as you walk through he says he says while sniffer dogs will still be able to go places electronic noses cant sensing technology will be better able to detect specific substances dr michael borgas is an atmospheric scientist at csiro which is developing an electronic nose to detect chemicals he says the future of airport chemical sensing lies in miniaturised devices researchers at csiro are also looking to insects like fruit flies for inspiration if you can understand how insects sense and act upon various volatile chemicals youd hopefully be able to mimic that with electronic devices he says what you want is a handheld device that can suck in tiny bits of air and detect the molecules that are in that air in airports youd just stick it in a passengers bag smart surveillance cebis says it will take more than hightech chemical sensors no matter how sensitive and discriminating they are its fine to have sensors all over the place but youve got to be able to make intelligent decisions he says the research challenge is to make cheap sensitive ubiquitous sensors coupled with smart surveillance technology cebis says closedcircuit tv will eventually be replaced by smart digital video technology that uses biometric identification and motion recognition to hone in on specific individuals and behaviour they look at a scene and if theres no motion they dont film anything he says or a person may wander into a scene deposit something and then move away the fact that something was moving and now isnt will be picked up ting shan of national ict australia nicta will outline advances in face recognition technology at a security technology conference in canberra next week shan says new face recognition algorithms have been developed by nicta and university of queensland that arent befuddled by lighting expression or angle of the face it can synthesise a realistic frontal face image he says impact of a new security environment borgas says while the events in the uk have highlighted advances in security technology he doubts they will be implemented overnight mccluskey hopes it will give governments an impetus to provide the research and development funds to allow some of the more promising ideas to bear fruit sometimes it takes an event of this nature to provide a significantly high profile and the government willing to take a chance on the technology he says cebis say all the technology in the world will never completely replace the most humble of checks but whether they need to be as intrusive and time consuming as they currently are depends on the technology he says long before gondwana existed it would have been possible to surf in central australia in areas that now look like this northern australia was once a separate land mass to the rest of the continent and it crashed into central australia wedging underneath it researchers say kate selway a geophysicist and phd student at the university of adelaide and colleagues have been studying the collision that is estimated to have happened billion years ago if you looked south from alice springs before that time you would have seen an ocean selway says most scientists have long suspected that the australian continent we know today is formed from pieces of land that were previously attached to other continents for example comparison of different rock types ages and chemistry suggest that long before eastern australia existed northern western and central australia were all discrete landmasses says selway when they collided some time less than two billion years ago mountains were formed which have long since eroded away she says but selway says no one has really known where exactly the boundaries of these separate plates were and how exactly they collided people had theories that these boundaries are there but theyve been hard to see because theyre largely covered by dirt and sediment she says which edge under which when continents collide the edge of one can wedge under the other in a process called subduction the prevailing theory has been that central australia subducted under northern australia says selway but she says there was never much data to back this up she and colleagues used a technique called magnetotellurics to peer hundreds of kilometres beneath the earths surface in the vicinity of the presumed boundary between northern and central australia just south of alice springs the technique relies on the fact that the earths magnetic field causes current to flow through rocks it measures the strength of the current as it changes with the electrical conductivity of different rock types selway and colleagues plotted the changing profile of electrical conductivity along a kilometre track north of the northern territorysouth australian border down to a depth of kilometres the profile shows that the northern plate was more conductive than the central one and it also shows that the northern plate is wedged under the central one and not the other way around because boundaries between plates can be places where minerals concentrate this kind of big picture geology helps the narrow down places to explore for minerals says selway some of the research which was funded by the northern territory geological survey was reported in geophysical research letters earlier this year the rest has been submitted to the journal geology selway is one of young scientists presenting their research to the public for the first time under the fresh science program the discovery of xena sparked the debate about the definition of a planet now the worlds astronomers are set to decide on which celestial body we invite into the planetary club the solar system may soon be home to a dozen planets with three new additions to the club and more to come if astronomers approve a new definition of a planet the proposal before the th general assembly of the international astronomical union iau in prague distinguishes between planets and smaller celestial bodies such as comets and asteroids it leaves plutos status as a planet intact but modified the proposed new definition of a planet would result in a planet solar system with eight classical planets three plutons a new growing category of plutolike objects including pluto ub dubbed xena and charon and ceres a former asteroid powerful new telescopes that have discovered large objects in the outer regions of the solar system present a challenge to the historically based definition of a planet which comes from the greek word meaning wanderer recent new discoveries have been made of objects in the outer regions of our solar system that have sizes comparable to and larger than pluto says iau president professor ron ekers these discoveries have rightfully called into question whether or not they should be considered as new planets the planetary debate blasted off in july when a us team of astronomers announced that pluto was much smaller than an enigmatic object ub which its discoverers said was the solar systems th planet ub found some billion kilometres from earth ignited a huge row as plutos defenders said ub was not a planet just a rock or kbo a kuiper belt object a kbo is one of about pieces of icy primeval debris encircling the sun on the outskirts of the solar system had astronomers realised in that pluto was smaller than our moon and with a mass well under that of the earth perhaps some special designation would have been devised for it say professor owen gingerich head of the iau committee that came up with the proposed definition since it was founded in the iau has been the arbiter in astronomical debates and after two years of work a committee has come up with a new planet definition to present to some astronomers gathered in the czech capital according to the draft definition a planet must orbit a star while not being itself a star and it must be massive enough for its own gravity to pull it into a nearly spherical shape our goal was to find a scientific basis for a new definition of planet and we chose gravity as the determining factor nature decides whether or not an object is a planet says professor richard binzel a member of the defining committee that puts about a dozen candidate planets on the iau watchlist which means even more planets could be named in the future if the current proposal is passed by the iau assembly the solar system would consist of the planets mercury venus earth mars ceres jupiter saturn uranus neptune pluto charon and ub a real name to be chosen later the new plutons are distinguished from classical planets in that they reside in orbits around the sun that take longer than years to complete meaning they are in orbit beyond neptune the draft planet definition will be discussed and refined during the meeting and put up for a vote on august our moon may qualify for the title of planet if it continues to move away from the earth the proposed new definition of a planet has got scientists talking some saying it means even our moon could one day be labelled a planet astronomer dr charles lineweaver of the australian national university says he is generally in favour of the draft international astronomical union iau definition but it has some potential problems according to the new definition of planets our moon will become a planet in the future says lineweaver under the draft definition which astronomers will vote on next week in prague a planet must orbit a star while not being itself a star and it must be massive enough for its own gravity to pull it into a nearly spherical shape under this definition charon would no longer be a satellite of pluto rather both would qualify as planets of the pluton type central to this doubleplanet system is a common centre of gravity or barycentre that exists in free space above the surface of pluto by contrast our moon would remain a satellite under the new definition because the barycentre of the system is located below the earths surface but lineweaver says as the moon is moving further away from the earth this means the barycentre will one day be above earths surface the moon will have to be about further away than it is now for it to become a planet he says based on an extrapolation of the current recession of the moon this will happen in about billion plus or minus billion years dust devils or willy willies cant be explained by wind alone scientists say its not just wind that raises sand and dust devils say physicists powerful electrical fields created by wind sand and dust also levitate more dust into the air the discovery could have implications for global climate modelling and even help explain what makes mars such a dusty world more than volts per metre of natural static electricity have been measured in desert dust storms and the minitornadolike dust devils or willy willies now under laboratory conditions jasper kok a graduate student at the university of michigan in ann arbor has reproduced the electrical fields found near the ground in desert wind storms and shown that they can also lift sand grains we were very surprised says kok of the power of electrical fields to raise dust and sand he and his faculty advisor associate professor nilton renno are publishing their results in a coming edition of geophysical research letters the process starts with a little dry wind in a dusty arid place that kicks up small dust grains so they collide with larger sand grains kok explains when this happens the smaller grains steal electrons from the larger grains giving the smaller grains a negative charge and the larger grains a positive charge its very similar to rubbing your feet on a carpet to become charged says kok in that case you are the smaller grain and the carpet is the larger grain next the negatively charged smaller grains are lifted above the ground by breeze creating a negatively charged region in the air above the positively charged ground that separation of charges is an electrical field once that field is in place as kok shows in the lab more grains can be lifted up by the electrical forces making for even dustier conditions than wind speed alone could create the phenomenon could have significant impacts on how much dust gets into the air worldwide which means its a matter that global climate modellers need to study more closely says dr ron miller of the nasa goddard institute for space studies in new york the many properties of dust dust is an aerosol which can reflect sunlight back into space and cool the earths surface as well as just influence the quality of the air for a given wind thats already kicking up dust youd get more dust says miller it could also affect areas downwind of a dust source he says by transporting the electrical fields to other areas and also more readily mobilising dust there that matters a lot in places like china where dust from the northern deserts whips south across industrial regions picking up a lot of pollutants that can then be blown east as far as the european alps dust on mars electrical fields may help explain how dust gets around on mars says renno on mars the wind required to lift dust from the surface is very large he says because the atmosphere of mars is very thin winds of the magnitude required have never been measured but theres dust everywhere kok says hes already working on a new laboratory experiment with marslike conditions to see if electrical fields may be at work on the red planet this doesnt smell familiar i think im lost italian researchers may have solved the puzzle of what makes homing pigeons such legendary navigators they simply follow their noses in a reallife homing experiment dr anna gagliardo of the university of pisa and colleagues tested the birds magnetic sensing and olfactory systems to establish how they make their extraordinary navigations across hundreds of kilometres the research published in the august issue of the journal of experimental biology followed a laboratory study by dr cordula mora and colleagues from the university of auckland new zealand in this research mora conditioned pigeons to detect an anomaly in a magnetic field she showed that pigeons detected a magnetic stimulus in their upper beaks by using the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve the largest cranial nerve the study reinforced the theory that homing pigeons navigate by using tiny magnetic particles in their beaks to map changes in the earths magnetic fields but gagliardo says they dont always use this method to find their way they do have the ability to detect magnetic fields but this doesnt mean they use it to navigate he says to test how much the birds use this sense gagliardo cut a section of the olfactory nerve in homing pigeons and a section of the opththalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve in another a third group of birds underwent sham operations and served as a control group gagliardo then released the three different groups of inexperienced homing pigeons about kilometres from their loft all but one of the birds with the severed trigeminal nerve were home the next day suggesting that the ability to detect magnetic fields is not used to navigate among the control group only one pigeon was lost meanwhile most of the birds deprived of their sense of smell were totally lost only four made it home a patchwork of smells according to gagliardo homing pigeons create odour maps of the areas they fly over and use them to navigate basically reading landscapes as a patchwork of odours in my view this study certainly ends the debate for homing pigeons says professor verner bingman a behavioural neuroscientist at bowling green state university ohio it is now as clear as can be that information about the spatial variation in atmospheric odours detected by the olfactory nerve is the primary sensory basis of the homing pigeon navigational map but associate professor martin wild a neurobiologist at the university of auckland who performed the surgical procedures for both the mora and gagliardo studies cautions that the pisa experiment should not be considered the definitive study on how pigeons navigate nature does not yield up her secrets so easily says wild the birds will use whatever sensory cues are available at the time showing that pigeons actually use a magnetic sense is extraordinarily difficult wild further points out that homing pigeons are thought to have two magnetic senses not just one one is in the beak and the other in the photoreceptors of the eye perhaps both are used under different circumstances he says could the hobbit really be one of us after all a new paper has inflamed the debate over the hobbits origins with one researcher criticising the scientific journal that published the research a paper in todays issue of the proceedings of the national academy of science pnas is the second this year to conclude that the hobbit is just a sick human indonesian researcher professor teuku jacob from gadjah mada university and an international team argue that the hobbit is a microcephalic pygmy rather than a new species of hominid all the odd things about it arent things which indicate another species says coauthor and anatomist dr alan thorne a visiting fellow at the australian national university it happens to be an individual human with major probably genetic deformities thorne says the team reached its conclusions by comparing anatomical features of the hobbit specimens with those of human specimens he says none of these features were outside the normal range for humans in particular australomelanesians which is his research speciality thorne says previous comparisons of the hobbit had been with inappropriate western european populations study and journal criticised but two of the original australian discoverers of the hobbit professor peter brown and professor mike morwood from the university of new england have lashed out at the researchers rejecting arguments put forward in the latest paper brown also criticises the journal itself for publishing the research brown says the papers conclusions are unsupported by any published evidence and that the paper makes misleading comments about previously published papers australian national university taxonomist professor colin groves who was not involved in the research also rejects the pnas paper most of their claims of pathology are not substantial says groves who has a paper due out in the journal of human evolution rejecting the microcephaly theory unethical conduct brown says putting aside the scientific argument itself pnas should not have published the research because of what he says is the research teams unethical scientific practice a claim the authors reject one of the sticking points is whether correct permission was obtained to study the precious hobbit bones the pnas article states that the researchers were permitted to study the hobbit materials in accordance with a research agreement between the indonesian national research centre of archaeology and the university of new england but brown and morwood say the researchers breached the agreement by removing the material from the archaeology centre in jakarta before the australian researchers had managed to complete their analysis it was removed without the agreement of both parties and without any conditions for proper credit says morwood brown is also critical that thorne had a flight to indonesia paid for by an australian tv company to examine the material but thorne says theres nothing improper about this the fact that my fares were paid by a television company is simply a function of the fact that im now retired and someone wants to pay my airfares im not going to knock it back he says brown also says the material was damaged beyond repair while being studied thorne says he didnt see the material after it was returned from jacobs lab but when he saw it it was in fine condition scientists behaving badly or a misunderstanding overall brown thinks the conduct of the pnas authors amounts to bad behaviour i cant think of a more extreme example of unethical scientific practice says brown for pnas to reward their behaviour casts aspersions on the journal thorne says he doesnt understand the claim he says he was invited to look at the material by jacob whom thorne had met many times over his decades of research in indonesia there was nothing unethical about that at all he says adding that the pnas paper had five referees including experts in anatomy pathology growth and development journal stands by its paper a spokesperson for the journal confirms the article was peerreviewed prior to submission and also by a member of the pnas editorial board before being accepted for publication pnas declined to comment on browns allegations instead referring abc science onlines questions to the study authors the star ae aurigae surrounded by dust which may be hiding deuterium and complicating astronomers efforts to study star and galaxy formation a sixyear study of a primordial element created just after the birth of the universe may force scientists to revise theories about how stars and galaxies formed using a telescope sensitive to far ultraviolet light astronomers have discovered that there is much more deuterium a heavy form of hydrogen created minutes after the big bang than expected our models of the chemical evolution of the milky way will have to be revised significantly says astrophysicist professor jeffrey linsky with the university of colorado at boulder all the deuterium that ever existed was believed to have been forged within a few minutes of the big bang billion years ago deuterium is a heavy version of regular hydrogen the lightest and most abundant element but its nucleus harbours a neutron in addition to the normal proton so it is twice hydrogens mass because stars consume deuterium and there is no known process to create more the isotope serves as a tracer for star formation and galaxy creation throughout time scientists thought they knew how much deuterium there was figuring about onethird of the original deuterium was remaining not so according to scientists using data from the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer or fuse launched in the fuse telescope breaks light into component wavelengths so scientists can determine which chemicals and other phenomena the beams might have passed through before striking the observatorys instruments the team provides the first hard evidence that deuterium can attach to interstellar dust grains as well as exist as a freefloating gas the finding explains why deuterium is not spread evenly throughout the galaxy but instead appears in clumps solving one puzzle however laid the groundwork for a far thornier question in adding up the amount of deuterium whether freeflying or bound to dust there was far more than expected since the s we have been unable to explain why deuterium levels vary all over the place linsky says the answer we found is as unsettling as it is exciting fuse found that the presentday deuterium abundance is less than below the primordial values rather than about this implies that either significantly less material has been converted to helium and heavier elements in stars or that much more primordial gas has rained down onto the galaxy over its lifetime than had been thought says linsky associate professor brian fields with the university of illinois in urbana says fuse has solved the mystery about why the deuterium is where it is now scientists need to try to explain why there is so much of it a relative of this ancient marine organism used to dig through the mud forming a network of tunnels trilobites the extinct marine creatures famous to fossilhunters everywhere may have once done digging of their own say uk and swedish researchers rocks found in a swedish limestone quarry contain the remains of trilobites inside networks of tunnels which appear to have been subsurface thoroughfares for the little buglike organisms its very rare to find a trilobite in a burrow says amherst colleges associate professor whitey hagadorn an expert on tracks burrows and other trace fossils that can give important clues to a longlost species behaviour and environment theres only one other such fossil known he says and even that one doesnt show evidence that the tunnels were much more than singleuse oneway streets that collapsed after the animals made their way through the muck the fact that they form open networks that is new and different says hagadorn such sandfilled tunnels are common in the fossil record he says and have generally been attributed to softbodied animals that left behind no hard parts but in recent years palaeontologists have begun to suspect that trilobites may have also done some digging finding trilobites inside tunnel remains in swedens millionyearold holen limestone is therefore a fitting but unexpected hint about how the ubiquitous creatures fit into the palaeozoic ocean ecosystem dr lesley cherns of cardiff university says these particular fossils were found by accident we sat down to lunch and i noticed that there were trilobites in these burrows says cherns who coauthored a paper in this months issue of the journal geology a life underground the trilobites were probably killed by something like a sudden upwelling of oxygenpoor water or some other quick and deadly event cherns explains the tunnels were then soon buried by a thick layer of mud that sealed them off from scavengers and helped to preserve the evidence noone is quite sure what the trilobites were doing underground they could have been hiding from the nautiluslike predators that cruised the palaeozoic oceans says cherns or they may have used the water flowing through the tunnels to help oxygenate their gills like some modern lobsters do she says hagadorn has other explanations they could have been going down to eat reproduce hide who knows hopefully this will motivate people to go out and look for more of these that could eventually answer some of those questions he says can terrorist tendencies become hardwired into the brain neuroscience can be a weapon against terrorism says a leading brain scientist who is investigating the neurology of belief professor susan greenfield director of the royal institution of great britain says there is no such thing as a brain centre for terrorism but she says that understanding the neurology of belief identity and risk can inform the way countries respond to terrorist threats as yet no one has started looking at the neuroscience of terrorism but neuroscience is really in the foothills of this very important question she says greenfield says the brain becomes individualised by the way connections between brain cells form mainly in the first years of life experiences during this time leave a mark on the brain essentially hardwiring the way we perceive and respond to our world embedding belief greenfield and colleagues at the oxford centre for science of the mind which she directs are investigating how belief is laid down in the brain this goes to the heart of terrorism she says which is basically a set of tactics founded on a belief system she says belief becomes embedded in the brain either through one single significant event or through constant repetition such as prayer or rituals rather than evidencebased deduction once adopted belief is very difficult to shake although the use of cognitive therapy to treat depression shows that it is possible to rewire the brain greenfield says yes you can rearrange peoples connections even in maturity so that they see the world in a different way she says risky business understanding risk is also a key factor in understanding what goes on in the mind of a terrorist she says greenfield suggests the high integration of technology in our lives is producing a generation more reckless than previous ones she says the instant gratification of technology prioritises experience above the consequences of our experiences producing an experientially biased society if you going to have the techno world driving momenttomoment experiences over learning and thought then it would follow that the next generation will be more reckless and prone to risk she says associate professor robert heath a psychologist and risk management consultant at the university of south australia says terrorists are both born and made he says terrorists have a psychological predisposition to violence and typically score highly on psychotism neuroticism and sociopathology but they also need a trigger point you need to have the disposition but you also need to have a belief set getting implanted in your head you also need to have a referent group thats a very strong influence he says how do we respond to terrorism greenfield says studying the brain can also shed light on how the general population responds to perceived threats what does it do to us as a society she says she says studies in lab rats show that the best way to induce neurosis is to engender a sense of perpetual threat without a way of avoiding it one of the hardest things for a human is to be told that youre in danger and not be allowed a way out or seen any means by which you can take evasive action she says so is it actually productive for governments to tell people youre in a high state of security if youre not allowing a compensatory action the turtles are an important source of protein for aboriginal people and children are taught to hunt them from an early age feral pigs are threatening the northern snakenecked turtle population in arnhem land to the point where the species could become extinct in some areas australian researchers predict in a single experiment feral pigs killed of radiotracked turtles in a monitored area within a threemonth period they dig them up like truffles says phd candidate damien fordham of the university of canberra whose research will be published in the journal biological conservation fordham says while the turtles are found across northern australia the consequences of extinction for the local indigenous population would be extreme northern snakenecked turtles have traditionally provided an important seasonal source of protein for indigenous communities in arnhem land not only would indigenous communities lose a valuable source of bush tucker but with it the strong cultural ties they have with the turtle fordham and colleagues mounted tiny radio tracking devices to the shells of snakenecked turtles around waterholes in indigenous land around maningrida kilometres east of darwin turtles aestivate or dig themselves into the mud to escape heat and lack of water during the late dry season anywhere between august to december of the recorded turtle deaths during the week period were attributed to feral pigs researchers believe feral pigs could have stumbled upon and then eaten some of the turtles while they were rooting around billabongs in search of morsels such as water chestnut but it was clear that in of turtle deaths the pigs had specifically located and dug them up generally pigs make a huge mess at they root around looking for food but researchers noted relatively undisturbed areas around the turtle deaths indicating a direct hit this is disturbing as it indicates that pigs actively seek out and prey on aestivating turtles fordham says the researchers predict more turtles will die as the feral pig population increases mathematical modelling of how many turtles survive in the year of the study if carried across all years could led to distinction of the turtles in the region the researchers note researchers say the turtles best hope for survival is a few years of good rainfall when pig predation rates are low fordham would also like to see government funding to fence in turtlerich areas the bullet cluster shown here was formed after two large clusters of galaxies collided the most energetic event since the big bang astronomers have announced the first direct evidence of dark matter although they still have only an inkling of what the elusive stuff is made of the unprecedented observations come from careful weighing of gas and stars flung about in the most violent and massive collision in the known universe its a tiff between two clusters of galaxies in whats collectively called the bullet cluster which has caused stars and dark matter from different galaxies to tear past each other while the more widely distributed interstellar gases collide and slow all the matter in a typical galaxy occupies the same space says astrophysicist dr maxim markevitch of the harvardsmithsonian center for astrophysics in this case the gas and galaxies are separated in space galaxies flew through each other but their gas clouds didnt so easily visualise for instance a cosmic millionkilometre per hour collision between two vast dollops of porridge with raisins in it the raisins would represent the stars and dark matter and the oats the gases the raisins would shoot through with few direct raisinonraisin hits while the oats would get stuck in a patch in the middle the result is different patches of space one with lots of hot colliding gas and two others on either side with all the dark matter and stars in visible galaxies the astrophysicists know the visible stars still have the dark matter with them because they weighed the mass in the starry patches by measuring how those patches bend the light from far more distant objects the more a starry region bends light the more massive it is in this case the starry areas in the colliding clusters have far more mass than can be accounted for by visible stars or by interstellar gases since the stars left the gases behind the only thing left to explain it is dark matter this proves in a direct and simple way that dark matter exists says markevitch suite of telescopes the discovery was made using a suite of observations from the orbiting hubble space telescope and chandra xray observatory along with the groundbased european southern observatory very large telescope and the magellan telescope a paper on the discovery will be published in the astrophysical journal letters a journal of the american astronomical society until now the existence of dark matter was inferred by the fact that galaxies have only onefifth of the visible matter needed to create the gravity that keeps them intact so the rest must be invisible to telescopes or dark the observations of the bullet cluster officially known as galaxy cluster e do not explain what dark matter is but they do provide one solid little hint says dr douglas clowe a researcher at the university of arizona in tucson we can place some constraints on dark matter particles he says clues to what dark matters made from it appears that dark matter particles whatever they are behave more like the raisins than the oats they are either widely spaced like stars or have some other way of avoiding collisions with each other its a small clue says clowe but seeing it play out in the bullet cluster makes it an unusually solid clue for whats so far proven to be the most mysterious stuff in the universe the great news about this is that it shows once and for all that dark matter exists says physicist assistant professor sean carroll of the university of chicago and that means he says theres less need to tweak einsteins laws of gravitation to explain whats seen in galaxies chocolate citrus or stinky researchers are identifying the fungi that give regional varieties of coffee their distinctive taste fungi are the secret to tasty coffee says a brazilian researcher who is the first to identify the moulds that give coffee its distinctive range of flavours and aromas dr martha taniwaki of brazils institute of food technology presented her research at the international mycological conference in cairns this week taniwaki says while the characteristics of the bean partly determine taste and aroma naturally occurring fungi also put the zing in your favourite brew we are doing a project to correlate the presence of certain species of fungi in coffee with coffee flavour she says the research team collected raw coffee beans from farms in sao paulo and minas gerais in brazil disinfected them incubated them for seven days and isolated the fungi then the team got down to the pleasant part of the experiment they roasted ground brewed and drank the raw samples rating them for body aroma acidity bitterness astringency and sweetness some of the flavours associated with moulds included floral citric caramel chocolate and toast the fungi occur naturally inside the coffee been and are associated with regional characteristics caused by soil climate and humidity while the pleasant tasteproducing fungi are not harmful to health others can be toxic and these often produce rancid stinky smoky woody or fermented bouquets tanawaki says her research is currently focused on isolating the various fungi and how they are metabolised but it may be possible to use the knowledge to produce ranges of coffee with a particular flavour potentially complementing the traditional bottles of vanilla or hazelnut flavourings found at your local cafe we can encourage the good fungi to grow and use it to produce good flavours like wine or other food like cheese where you use mould or yeast to give a special flavour she says professor paul gadek an australian plant molecular biologist and head of tropical plant sciences at james cook university says taniwakis research has implications for australia where coffee is a growth industry he says it would be interesting to find out which species of fungi are found in australian coffee beans what are the characteristics that we can grow regionally to generate distinctive flavours researchers can now test the effects of airborne toxins on human lung cells grown in the lab researchers are using minilungs made from cells grown in the lab to test the effects of airborne toxins after workplace contamination and chemical spills the work has won dr amanda hayes shahnaz bakand and chris winder of the university of new south wales unsw a eureka prize for research that replaces the use of animals or animal products hayes says the use of human epithelial lung cells reduces the need for what are often inhumane tests on animals traditionally the toxicity of gases and vapours are tested on lab animals that are put into a chamber and subjected to lethal doses but hayes says the need for such tests can be reduced by using human epithelial cells grown on a porous membrane she says the method is well suited to field work because all investigators need to do is place the cellcontaining membrane in a small diffusion chamber and pump in air the minilungs can be subjected to a range of tests including energy metabolism and viability to see how they are responding to the toxin any cell death resulting from the exposure would immediately set alarm bells ringing hayes says her group the only in australia to use lung cells in this way has been able to test the effects of chemicals like ammonia and formaldehyde and volatile organic compounds found in paints solvents and pesticides the research may open new possibilities for toxicity testing of industrial chemicals environmental contaminants respiratory drugs workplace airborne contaminants and fire combustion products she says hayes says the cells tend to be more sensitive to toxins than a functioning lung but the in vitro effects of the toxins on the cells tally well with effects observed in animals the same method can be used to test airborne toxicology on skin and liver cells she says other recipients of eureka

australian prodigy professor terence tao has won the mathematics worlds version of a nobel prize the fields medal for contributions to harmonic analysis and numerical theory tao aged just wins the medal with russian recluse dr grigory perelman frenchman professor wendelin werner and russian professor andrei okunkov the medal is another claim to fame for the adelaideborn academic who earned his phd from princeton university at and was full professor of mathematics at the university of california los angeles ucla at asked why he devotes himself to pushing the boundaries of the discipline tao says because its fun what interests me is the connection between maths and the real world he said following an awards ceremony at the international congress of mathematicians in madrid eemeritus professor alf van der poorten of the centre for number theory research at macquarie university in sydney salutes taos achievement its a wonderful thing for australian mathematics he was a young genius and australia had people in place to look after him he comes back quite regularly says van der poorten professor john garnett former ucla college chair of mathematics recently placed tao on a level with mozart except without mozarts personality problems mathematics just flows out of him garnett says tao was awarded the fields medal for his work on a branch of maths that uses equations from physics in the theoretical field of harmonic analysis a discipline that focuses on acoustic wave frequencies he also specialises in disciplines including algebraic geometry and number theory another branch of taos research has been prime numbers based on theories first put forward more than two thousand years ago by the greek mathematician euclid russian recluse meanwhile perelman the russian mathematician who won the medal with tao declined to attend the ceremony choosing instead to stay at home and watch television he declined to comment on the award and on the reasons why he is shunning publicity perelman resigned from the steklov mathematics institute suddenly in january without explanation former colleagues say they have not seen him since in perelman won an award at the second european congress of mathematics in budapest russian newspapers say that he turned down the prize because he considered the jury insufficiently qualified but perelmans international fame in the mathematics world came in and when he published two papers online that appeared to solve the poincareacute conjecture the riddle had perplexed mathematicians since it was posited by frenchman henri poincare in in just pages of sketchily written notes perelman seemed to prove it but he never published a full proof in academic journals the conjecture was one of the socalled millenium prize problems for which the clay mathematics institute in boston announced a onemilliondollar prize perelman never picked up the prize money there may be remnants of neanderthal genes in the nuclear dna of people with european ancestors people of european descent may be neanderthal according to a dna study that questions whether modern humans left africa and replaced all other existing hominids the same study published in the latest issue of the journal plos genetics also says west africans could be related to an archaic human population as both groups spread the findings suggest we all have a bit of archaic dna in our genes instead of a population that left africa years ago and replaced all other archaic human groups we propose that this population interacted with another population that had been in europe for much longer maybe years says vincent plagnol plagnol a researcher in the department of molecular and computational biology at the university of southern california and colleague assistant professor jeffrey wall analysed patterns of ancestral linkage in modern individuals they looked at people from utah with ancestors from northern and western europe and yoruba people from west africa using statistics and computer modelling the researchers focused on linkage disequilibriums or sections within genes that did not make sense if only modern human matings are considered the missing genetic links only fit if some other hominid population is introduced into the model the scientists say we considered the data from modern human dna and fitted a model to explain what we see explains plagnol we found that a simple model cannot explain the data if we do not add an ancestral population if this population did not cross with modern humans or almost did not the effect is too small to explain the data we find that a rate of is what is needed to explain what we see the researchers agree with recent studies that conclude neanderthals did not contribute any mitochondrial dna or mtdna genetic material that is passed from mothers to children but they say other portions of the european genome such as those associated with nuclear dna may still harbour the neanderthal imprint plagnol says different parts of the genome have different ancestry so an individual could have a fraction of a certain chromosome that is inherited from a neanderthal but then possess very typical homo sapiens mtdna the scientists are not certain which early human group could have contributed to west african dna but both europeans and africans in the study showed about the same archaic contribution neanderthals are believed to have originated in africa around years ago but they left and then settled in europe hence the apparent lack of interaction with modern humans in africa alan templeton professor of evolutionary and population programs at the university of michigan has also conducted dna studies and comes to similar conclusions the humans who were in africa and the humans who were in eurasia were regularly interchanging genes he says there was interbreeding and when humans came out of africa years ago they did not replace these other human populations in eurasia new technologies are being developed to sequence nuclear dna from fossils so in the near future scientists may learn more about how modern human genes compare with those of archaic humans like neanderthals the scientists removed a single cell from the embryo using a technique more commonly used in ivf labs a us biotechnology company says it has developed a way to make human embryonic stem cells without destroying the original embryo the development published online today in the journal nature could dispel ethical objections to medical research using such cells it is possible to generate stem cells without destroying the embryo and without destroying its potential for life says dr robert lanza chief scientist at advanced cell technology in massachusetts stem cells are the bodys master cells available from many sources but many experts believe the most powerful and versatile cells may be those taken from daysold embryos scientists hope to study these cells discover which compounds enable them to produce any kind of body tissue and replicate that to make tailored treatments for diseases such as cancer diabetes and parkinsons lanzas team used a method already used in fertility treatments to remove one cell from a human embryo without harming it the scientists then grew stem cells from that single cell although the source embryos were not then implanted in a woman the scientists say they could have been with the potential to develop normally the team used spare embryos from fertility clinics and let them grow to the to cell stage the embryo at that stage is no longer able to divide into twins but the cells can still form any cell or tissue in the body lanzas team managed to get different cells to grow and got two stemcell batches or lines these cell lines were genetically normal and retained their potential to form all of the cells in the human body including nerve liver blood vascular and retinal cells that could potentially be used to treat a range of human diseases the researchers write dr ronald green a dartmouth college ethics professor who reviewed the experiment for the company says he is unsure that opponents would accept this research immediately but he believes they would eventually i think many of the opponents are going to bridle at this he says people are unprepared for scientific breakthroughs to resolve these ethical issues dr kathy hudson director of the genetics and public policy center at johns hopkins university says questions remain over the effect of the procedure on an original embryo and the longterm health of any resulting children lanza agrees that the method should not be immediately used on people but this is worth studying he says his company would make any stem cell lines available to scientists for free gigantic stromatolites in the billionyearold tumbiana formation in the pilbara region of western australia these indicate that oxygenproducing cyanobacteria were already flourishing in the archaean era there might have been more oxygen in the atmosphere billions of years ago than anyone thought says an international team of scientists drilling in outback australia the scientists say that their study of ancient rocks in the pilbara region of western australia may force people to rethink accepted theories of how the prehistoric earths atmosphere developed they publish their results today in the journal nature up to now it has been generally accepted that the earths atmosphere was devoid of oxygen for some of its existence the popular model is that there was little oxygen in the earths atmosphere before about billion years ago says lead author professor hiroshi ohmoto of pennsylvania state university but ohmotos team has cast doubt on the theory after finding sulfur isotopes indicating prevalent oxygen that predate the accepted start of atmospheric oxygenation the key lies in the fact that while all isotopes of sulfur behave the same chemically they have slightly differing masses according to the amount of atmospheric oxygen at the time isotopes from two sulfur samples the team analysed one billion years old from a lake bed and the other billion years old from the sea bed did not indicate an oxygenstarved atmosphere we analysed the sulfur composition and could not find the abnormal sulfur isotope ratio indicating no oxygen ohmoto says this is the first time that sediment that old was found to contain no abnormal sulfur isotope ratio the team concludes that there are several possible explanations oxygen levels could have fluctuated wildly over the millennia going from oxygenless before billion years ago to oxygenated between and billion years ago then back to oxygenless from to billion years ago alternatively the atmosphere could have contained oxygen as early as billion years ago and that sulfur usually associated with no oxygen might have been produced at a time of violent volcanic activity either way the scientists say the accepted theories about how the atmosphere evolved needs to be reevaluated its just not the same any more dogs feel especially intense jealousy pangs in a love triangle involving their owner and another more recently introduced person or animal a new study suggests the finding suggests dogs may also experience pride embarrassment shame and other secondary emotions outside the basic emotions such as anger anxiety and surprise scientists previously thought only humans and chimpanzees showed behaviours linked to secondary emotions a genetic propensity for jealousy may even run as deep as a dogs ancient wolf ancestors the researchers say i would definitely think you would find jealousy in wolves says lead researcher dr paul morris for example sexual jealousy would be an extremely powerful motivator in the wild state jealousy would also relate to position in hierarchy and alliances between animals within a pack morris a university of portsmouth psychologist and a member of the universitys centre for the study of emotion and colleague christine doe studied domestic animal owners in the south of england the researchers asked the pet owners to report observations of both primary and secondary emotions in their animals which included cats pigs horses rabbits rats and hamsters as well as dogs all the animals received high scores for secondary emotions with over of owners saying their dogs showed signs of jealousy when morris and doe interviewed participants about their observations owners repeatedly said their pooches seemed jealous when they introduced a new person or animal to the family lost love morris also studied the phenomenon directly with his own two dogs silver and jessie he went out of his way to shower silver with attention and then only occasionally gave jessie her usual pat on the head jessie showed her teeth and snarled but contained her anger and tried to push her way back into the mini pack jealousy is at its heart related to the real or anticipated loss of love affection and attention says morris dog jealousy is different to human jealousy in that it is tied to the here and now dog jealousy occurs only in the presence of the interloper so when i talk about dog jealousy i see it as a much more primitive and hugely less elaborate version of human jealousy a range of emotions marc bekoff a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the university of colorado is the author of numerous studies and books on animal emotions most recently two books coauthored with primate researcher dr jane goodall he agrees with the new findings i believe that dr morris is right dogs and other animals do exhibit secondary emotions such as jealousy he says ive studied the emotional lives of animals for more than years and was pleased to see his results morris who will present his work on canine jealousy at next months british association for the advancement of science ba festival of science in norwich next plans to study evidence of guilt in dogs and pride in horses male satin bowerbird inspecting the decorations at his bower male satin bowerbirds roam the streets and countryside thieving treasures to adorn their bedrooms australian researchers find but there is no honour among thieves while theyre out poaching their own homes are plundered and their finest treasures blue plasticlined bottle tops and tail feathers stolen so why do bowerbirds prefer one treasure over another this is the question researchers including janine wojcieszek an honours student at the university of queensland at the time of the research wanted to find out now she and her colleagues report their findings in the journal emu austral ornithology male bowerbirds build stick structures that serve as the base for courtship and mating they decorate their bowers with colourful objects and are known to steal decorations from each other the male satin bowerbird ptilonorhynchus violaceus is particularly drawn to blue objects and researchers hypothesise this could be for reasons of vanity or practicality its interesting that different bowerbird species have preferences for different colours the species we looked at particularly like blue things while the spotted bowerbird that is found in western queensland prefers white silver and pinks says wojcieszek one theory is that the bowerbirds choose the colour that best accentuates their own colour because satin bowerbirds are blue they seek blue to show themselves off another theory and one that researchers believe is more likely is that satin bowerbirds choose blue because thats its allotted colour in the bowerbird world the researchers studied a male bowerbird population around the bunya mountains northwest of brisbane wojcieszek labelled the contents of nearly bowers and then returned each day for three months a mating season to see what had been added and stolen from the bower what she found was a merrygoround of gathering and stealing every day there were changes to the bowers either they had stolen something or something had been stolen from them the most popular objects and those most likely to be stolen were items that reflected ultraviolet light top of the list were tail feathers from the crimson rosella bird and plastic bottle tops lined with dark blue plastic while the tail feathers were stolen more than any other class of decoration the blue bottle tops were the most popular decoration relative to their availability on bowers archaeological evidence from ancient dung suggests that the people who lived here kept sheep or goats the discovery of a neolithic complex of caves in greece suggests not all cavemen were clubwielding nomadic huntergatherers but included some farmers and shepherds they even had the stone age equivalent of a toolshed evidence of such homebody cave dwellers comes from a recent excavation of a cave complex dating from bc the abode features plastered floors and evidence of cropgrowing and an attached stable nearby this household was selfcontained says dr panagiotis karkanas who conducted the excavation of the kouveleiki caves located on the cliffs of a shallow valley in the southern peloponnese i believe that the site was an ordinary household the people were living there cooking sleeping etc probably during the whole year they were both farmers and shepherds says karkanas an archaeologist at the ephoreia of palaeoanthropologyspeleology in athens karkanas came to this conclusion after studying objects uncovered within the caves and after performing a detailed microanalysis of the cave sediments findings will be published in the november issue of the journal of archaeological science the complex consists of two caves the first of which is divided into two chambers by several rock blocks that appear to have fallen from the roof before the caves were inhabited the cavemen used this natural divide to their advantage since one of the fallen rocks was curved and straightened to resemble a wall which created a corridor between the two chambers burnt manure found in the front chamber suggests a few animals probably sheep and goats were housed there karkanas says the animals were probably milkers or very young cereal husks and residue found within the dung indicates the cave dwellers probably farmed the land in front of the caves he points out that farming in greece started at about bc at the beginning of the neolithic era or the new stone age in the first cave he found fine painted pottery polished axes spindle whirls clay and marble figurines grinders and a collection of obsidian chert and quartz tools the dark back room measuring about square metres appears to have been the main area of habitation evidence for hearth fires was found and the floor was plastered with a mixture of burnt dung and red clay karkanas suggests this type of plaster was unusual for the time though it became popular later and is still used today plaster made of dung sometimes burnt and clay is common today in some villages in africa and india he says he says the second cave was probably used as a complementary activity area sort of the prehistoric version of a tool shed nine human burials discovered within the caves suggests some people may have lived their entire lives at the site moving to the caves curtis runnels professor of archaeology at boston university says he finds karkanas paper to be both informative and convincing the move to caves came for many reason among which was the reorganisation of the economy during this period to emphasise sheep and goat herding he says part of the change was a focus on the production of wool and hair for textiles which were traded for imported materials possibly exotic flint or obsidian runnels thinks people who wanted to practice both farming and herding moved to caves in the somewhat remote agriculturally marginal regions then as the new find suggests they settled down no longer the ninth planet an artists impression of pluto and its moon charon this weeks surprise decision to strip pluto of its planet status has triggered a universe of reactions from astronomers some philosophical others downright shocked after heated debate among members of a strong meeting of the international astronomical union iau in prague pluto has been redefined as a dwarf planet it is now considered a distinct object from the other eight traditional planets of the solar system mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus and neptune australian astronomer dr simon johnston from the parkes observatory in new south wales is shocked at the decision up to a week ago i thought we had planets he says referring to a definition released by the iau last week that would have expanded rather than reduced the number of planets the overseer of science investigations on nasas new horizons mission to pluto calls the reclassification rash and illogical i think people are going to consider pluto a planet regardless says dr alan stern of the southwest research institute in boulder colorado what they did was scientifically ludicrous and publicly embarrassing he says pluto is a planet with clouds weather and geology philosophical but other astronomers are more philosophical including dr mike brown of the california institute of technology pluto is dead says brown who in discovered an object larger than pluto that many claimed was the th planet brown now accepts the icy rock called ub and nicknamed xena will also be categorised as a mere dwarf planet under the new definition pluto would never be considered a planet if it were discovered today and i think the fact that weve now found one kuiperbelt object bigger than pluto underscores its shaky status says brown im of course disappointed that xena will not be the th planet but i definitely support the iau in this difficult and courageous decision he says it is scientifically the right thing to do and is a great step forward in astronomy several johns hopkins university astronomers describe the decision as a muddled ruling that is unlikely to settle ongoing debates over how to define a planet and whether the term should apply to pluto in an informal poll only one astronomer was pleased to hear about plutos new status but at least one astronomer appears indifferent to the decision the classification doesnt matter says dr louis friedman executive director of the planetary society pluto and all solar system objects are mysterious and exciting new worlds that need to be explored and better understood pluto fails the test plutos status has been contested for many years by astronomers who say its tiny size and highly eccentric orbit precludes it from joining the other acknowledged planets this discovery of xena prompted questions as to whether pluto and other largish objects could be considered planets or just simply rocks rubble left over from the formation of the solar system the iau defined the core difference between a planet and a dwarf planet as whether the celestial object has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit in other words whether the object is massive enough to wield a gravity that draws in rocks and other debris that may clutter its orbital path this criterion disqualified pluto whose eggshaped orbit overlaps neptunes the scientists also agreed that to be called a planet a celestial body must be massive enough for its own gravity to pull it into a nearly spherical shape and it must orbit around a star while not itself being a star the large asteroid ceres along with pluto and xena will also be defined as a dwarf planet this is according to the iau an important new class of transneptunian objects around a dozen other objects are already dwarf candidates and all other objects except satellites will be known as small solar system bodies under the new definition hate mail from angry children pluto was discovered in by a yearold american astronomer clyde tombaugh who died in january convinced he had achieved eternal recognition as the discoverer of the solar systems ninth planet tombaughs announcement smashed the perceived boundaries of the solar system established years earlier with the discovery of neptune this weeks prague vote will have similarly widespread public implications with models and textbooks of the solar system becoming instantly obsolete officials at the american museum of natural history in new york who have been at the vanguard of the movement to demote pluto say they have already received irate calls from the public we had enormous numbers of telephone calls and i would say things that verged on hate mail from secondgraders very angry children who said what have you done this is the cutest most disneyesque of the planets how could you possibly demote it says dr michael shara the museums astrophysics curator its going to be a difficult thing to accept at first but we will accept it eventually and thats the right scientific and cultural thing to do says brown but at least one young visitor to the smithsonian institutions national air and space museum yearold quinn huebner is happy its one less planet to memorise he says torres strait islanders with diabetes may be placing their kidneys under further strain by eating dugongs contaminated with cadmium high cadmium levels in dugongs and turtles in australias north may be affecting the kidneys of torres strait islanders who eat these animals as delicacies preliminary research suggests research led by epidemiologist dr melissa haswellelkins of the university of queenslands north queensland health equalities promotion unit suggests the cadmium may be worsening torres strait islanders diabetesrelated kidney damage but until the team has more data haswellelkins is recommending torres strait islanders keep eating these traditional foods she says earlier studies have found that the cadmium comes from natural sources in the ocean rather than industrial pollution and concentrates in the liver and kidneys of dugongs and turtles studies show cadmium levels in these longlived animals are well above acceptable levels haswellelkins says this may be an issue she says as there is some suggestion that the kidneys of people with diabetes are more sensitive to being damaged by cadmium so her team investigated the possible impact of the cadmium from traditional seafoods on torres strait islanders indigenous australians who are already at risk from kidney damage due to diabetes the researchers found that people who eat more dugong and turtle have more cadmium in their urine and also worse albuminuria a marker of kidney damage in which high levels of the protein albumin are excreted in the urine the researchers think that cadmium in traditional foods could be contributing to diabetesrelated kidney damage and they think health researchers should pay more attention to cadmium as one of the many factors that can affect kidney health but haswellelkins says its too early to say whether the cadmium is causing the kidney damage or whether alreadydamaged kidneys are simply allowing more cadmium to escape in the urine she says people should not be afraid of eating their traditional foods until we understand how significant this source of cadmium is she says it is best to be more concerned about the wellestablished risk factors for diabetes such as hypertension lack of exercise poor diet alcohol obesity and smoking some of the teams research has been published online in the journal of exposure science and environmental epidemiology the fingertip device can sense acceleration and inertia to more accurately mimic a real finger a fingertip device that recognises hand gestures and senses texture is being developed in the us the digitiser could one day input information without a keyboard come in handy for gaming where it could imitate squeezing a trigger and be worn to paint on a screen by moving a finger through the air the fingertip digitizer was developed by mechanical engineer youngseok kim and associate professor thenkurussi kesavadas director of the university at buffalos virtual reality laboratory they say it could be used for everything from inputting information into a computer or pda to transferring the physical characteristics of an object to a computer for design purposes with this device a computer cell phone or computer game could read human intention more naturally says kesavadas eventually the fingertip digitizer may be used as a highend substitute for a mouse a keyboard or a joystick according to kim and kesavadas other gesturerecognition devices available on the market can sense movement but not force and although there are several forcefeedback or haptic devices none can measure details of dynamic fingertip activities including acceleration and inertia our digitiser bridges the contact and noncontact input strategy says kim we keep track of everything happening on your fingertip after all says kesavadas the fingertip is the most intuitive interface humans already posses we use it to point push buttons touch objects and sense textures the duos device is equipped with three sensors to give it a broad range of function a position sensor keeps tracks of where the digitiser is in d space and captures its direction an accelerometer gauges speed and a force sensor at the tip measures pressure who needs ghostbusters when youve got newton says a scientist who has used physics and maths to poke holes in the way hollywood depicts ghosts and vampires in a paper published recently on the physics website arxiv theoretical physicist professor costas efthimiou of the university of central florida shows that when it comes to things supernatural the figures just dont add up for instance the ability to walk through walls is a common talent of celluloid ghosts but newtons laws of physics suggest that if a ghost can walk it shouldnt be able to pass through walls say efthimiou and cornell university postgraduate student sohan gandhi newton says a body at rest will remain at rest until its acted on by an external force and for every action there is an equal but opposite reaction so in order to walk we apply a backward force on the floor with our feet propelling the feet up and us forwards but if a ghost can walk through walls it must be materialless the authors argue and incapable of exerting force by the same token a ghost that can walk through walls should also sink through the floor and a ghost that can walk should be bouncing off the walls it tries to pass through the depiction of ghosts walking contradicts the precept that ghosts are materialless they write ghostly chills sharp drops in temperature are also associated with the arrival of a ghost but the paper says physics which suggests that a sense of cold is correlated more to the rate at which heat is transferred from bodies to the environment than actual temperature can provide an explanation it has become almost a hollywood clich that the entrance of a ghostly presence be foreshadowed by a sudden and overwhelming chill they write this feature of supposed ghost sightings lends itself naturally to physical explanation efthimiou and gandhi say when a warm object is placed next to a cold object energy flows from the warm body to the cooler body cooling the warm body in a room with a high window or a door with a gap the cool air from outside displaces warm air inside creating a system of heat cycles and eddies the effect is increased because humans are more sensitive to rapid changes in temperature even if the absolute change is small a uk investigation of the famous haunted gallery at hampton court by the university of hertfordshires dr richard wiseman found that hidden doors were letting in draughts this produced a combination of air currents that caused temperatures to plummet up to c in some parts the paper says blood suckers efthimiou and gandhi also use the mathematical principle of geometric progression to rule out the existence of vampires they argue it would take just two and a half years for vampires to wipe out the entire human race from the day the first one appeared based on the myth that vampires turn their victims into other vampires by sucking their blood if vampires feed once a month the great grandaddy of all vampires would have killed one human and produced one vampire in the first month so in total there would be two vampires and one less human or a tally of vampires humans by the next month the vampires would kill humans and so on after n months there would be x x x n or a geometric progression with ratio the vampire population increases geometrically and the human population decreases geometrically they say using the principle of reductio ad absurdum they conclude that vampires cant exist as their existence contradicts the existence of humans professor alan carey dean of the mathematical sciences institute at the australian national university says the paper successfully debunks the depictions of the supernatural in the movies they poke holes in the clichs and mistakes that are made and thats not too hard to do he says archaeolgists believe structures like the tevaitau fort reflect hostility between population groups competing for resources the polynesians had trouble reaching remote south pacific islands according to a new study that dents their reputation as great seafarers an archaeological study shows they settled rapa an island southeast of tahiti more recently than anyone thought professor atholl anderson of the australian national university and international colleagues publish their research in the current issue of the journal antiquity dating of charcoal from archaeological sites on the square kilometre island suggests the first settlers arrived at rapa as late as around ad anderson says the findings come after dates for the settlement of nearby easter island were recently revised to around the same time what these pieces of archaeological research show is that the more isolated islands were reached very late in the history of the settlement of the pacific indicating that probably the seafaring technology was not as good as we once thought anderson says the polynesians were once regarded as almost superhuman seafarers who could go anywhere that they wanted but now it doesnt look like that at all it looks like they actually had great difficulty finding these remote and isolated places anderson says the polynesians are believed to have radiated out from islands like fiji tonga and samoa to more remote islands like rapa after a year migratory lull driven further afield by population pressure and food shortages mysterious forts after rapa was settled the population rapidly increased and spread across the island anderson says archaeological analysis of swamps shows signs of rapid deforestation and erosion along the coast suggesting the population was running out of land to plant taro crops the population apparently splintered into competing groups that set up formidable stone forts consisting of a central tower surrounded by domestic terraces its always been a bit of a mystery as to why this very isolated island should have such a huge number of massive forts on it anderson says the forts represent the time that it becomes a highly competitive society and they were simply fighting all the time radiocarbon dating suggests they relocated from their coastal rock shelters to inland fortresses about years after arriving and about years before the first contact with europeans in the conclusions are based on radiocarbon dates from a variety of sites including five of the known coastal shelters and four of the fortifications a microcosm of the world the university of oregons assistant professor douglas kennett who coauthored the paper says rapa tells a compelling story of population expansion environmental degradation and increasing warfare rapa is a little microcosm of our planet there are lessons about the consequences of population growth to be learned there he says anderson says time has recorded a classic pattern at rapa the argument is if any population is confined it overuses its resources and the result of that is almost always competition between units groups families and ultimately war in some parts of the world it really is a mans world researchers say sex selection in societies that favour boys mean there are at least million missing females a preference for male babies and a resulting sexratio imbalance could lead to a destabilised society researchers warn their study in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences says the imbalance would leave more men unmarried raising the risks of antisocial and violent behaviour the researchers say that parts of china and india would have more men over the next years many of them in rural areas and with a limited education the growing number of young men with a lack of family prospects will have little outlet for sexual energy write dr zhu wei xing of chinas zhejian normal university and dr therese hesketh of the institute of child health at university college london this trend would lead to increased levels of antisocial behaviour and violence as gender is a wellestablished correlate of crime and especially violent crime they say adding the trend would threaten stability and security in many societies sex ratios are already distorted in large parts of asia and north africa and sexselective abortion and discrimination in healthcare for girls have led to higher female mortality there are now an estimated million missing females in india and china alone the researchers write china introduced a onechild policy in to control population growth but it has led to a rise in the maletofemale ratio from in to in according to a study published this month in the british medical journal in and of the population in china and india respectively were female in contrast females comprise of the total population in east asia and in all of europe and central asia according to figures from the world bank the authors called for measures to reduce sex selection and an urgent change in cultural attitudes or dire consequences could follow when single young men congregate the potential for more organised aggression is likely to increase substantially and this has worrying implications for organised crime and terrorism they say this mite came to a sticky end millions of years ago in the peruvian amazon insects that became trapped in tree resin between and million years ago show that amazonia hosted an astonishingly rich variety of life french researchers say the resin which hardened into glasslike amber has yielded at least previously unidentified species of insects three species of mites as well as more than new species of algae lichen and other microorganisms a team led by dr pierreolivier antoine at the university of toulouse publishes the research online today in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences it is the third amber fossil find in south america but the first in amazonia of the insect species belong to different families which demonstrates that amazonia was already hot humid and a remarkable generator of biodiversity in the middle miocene an era that spanned to about million years ago antoine says fossilised insects and microorganisms are extremely rare as they do not have a tough internal skeleton like for instance dinosaurs early birds or hominids as a result these tiny fossils only turn up in exceptional finds embedded in amber or in finegrain chalky deposits three expeditions have been carried out to explore the amber deposit which was found accidentally on the banks of the amazon near the peruvian city of iquitos and is covered by river water for much of the year about fragments of amber totalling around grams have been recovered from the site and are still being analysed to find so many species in such a small quantity of amber proves that at that time amazonia had phenomenal biodiversity close to todays says antoine some scientists have argued that amazonias broad variety of life was acquired relatively recently the team from frances national centre for scientific research cnrs says that some of the specimens are so extraordinarily preserved that some cells appear to be undamaged if so there are hopes that enough dna may be recovered from them to build a family tree of their genetic lineage the cnrs says the emerging space tourism market has sparked the need to reassess what we really mean by space a legal expert says we need a legal definition of where space begins and ends to ensure future space tourists get what they pay for says an australian expert in space law associate professor steven freeland from the university of western sydney will speak about emerging issues in space law at a seminar next week freeland says there are plenty of laws and treaties dealing with what we can and cant do in space for example its illegal to claim territory in space or to use space for military or nonpeaceful purposes but he says theres no actual legal demarcation of where space begins and the sky ends the argument has always been why do we really care why do we really need to know but he says new technology including the prospect of a growing space tourism market has given these questions a pressing new relevance if we look at space tourism people are going to want a certificate that says ive been in space not hey youve been very high up in the air he says and from a commercial perspective the industry would love to be able to say youve been in space because youre not going to pay us to be very high up in the air whats a life worth in space freeland says other space tourism issues potentially affected by whether a craft is in space or the air include insurance liability traffic control and rescue obligations even the right to claim the term astronaut may have to be revisited some operators say well all become astronauts and well get our astronaut wings but astronaut is a term under space law he says are you and i an astronaut just because we paid money to sit in this thing freeland says the existing space laws are badly in need of an overhaul because developments like space tourism were never envisioned at the time they were drafted you have to have legal certainty about what law applies whether its international air law or international law of outer space or a combination of both he says who decides currently decisions about matters like demarcation are made by the united nations general assembly on the basis of recommendations from its committee on the peaceful uses of outer space copuos copuos takes advice from bodies like the international institute of space law of which freeland is a member he says while australia set something of a benchmark in defining space as beginning at kilometres above sea level under its space activities legislation international bodies have been slow to act freeland says demarcation was at the top of the list when copuos first met in but here we are and we still dont have a legal demarcation he says major players in the space race like the us have resisted moves to pin down a definition of space largely because it could restrict their ability to carry out certain activities that would be banned or limited under space law new orleans houses swamped by floodwaters after hurricane katrina in the year since the levees broke in new orleans scientists and engineers have found a lot of reasons for hope and despair about the future of louisianas coast the good news is that the solution may be in the mississippi river itself the bad news is that some coastal areas including new orleans could be sinking a lot faster than expected maybe too fast or maybe not first theres that murky mississippi water mark twain who had a stint as a mississippi riverboat pilot reported that a glass of the fresh muddy river water was once considered wholesomer to drink than clear water of the ohio river on account of the yaller mud in fact each year the great river carries about million tonnes per year of silt sand and gravel through engineered channels past new orleans and into the depths of the gulf of mexico thats equivalent to superdomes packed tight with dirt each year says denise reed professor of geology and geophysics at the university of new orleans who has been working on finding solutions for the coast year in and year out million tonnes adds up to a whole lot of real estate flowing freely right into then right out of a place that is losing land at more than square kilometres each year here we are going capinhand to congress for money when our most valuable resource is being wasted reed says if instead of being artificially channelled to the southernmost tip of the mississippi delta and dumped into deeper waters most of that muddy water sediment were allowed to flow into the shallow surf zones further north it would get caught up in the neverending shoving match between the river and the sea once there as is the case along any shoreline near a river ocean waves would serve as natures free earthmoving machines and build up beaches that could protect the land from storm surf its the very process that built the louisiana coast in the first place reed says the mother lode is still being wasted she says we have got to keep it in the shallow water muddy process so just what kind of project would keep that liquid real estate in louisiana while at the same time protecting homes and cities maintaining a navigable river and restoring the troubled mississippi delta wetlands that question is now the focus of feverish discussion and planning by louisianas brandnew coastal protection and restoration authority or cpr authority says robert twilley a professor of wetlands biogeochemistry at louisiana state university lsu back in november just two months after katrina the louisiana state legislature created the cpr authority by blending together the state department of natural resources and the state department of transportation and development what this means says twilley is that for the first time protection which usually means buildings is being integrated with restoration which usually refers to coastal wetlands for decades the two goals have been largely perceived as opposites it completely changed overnight our bedfellows says twilley it really has in the last year focused a very clear discussion on levees and wetlands as an integrated protection system the cpr authoritys first daunting task is to work with the various levee boards and the federal government to craft a comprehensive protection and restoration plan for the louisiana coast the plan is to be gleaned from vast amounts of data and delivered to the public in january twilley says muddy mystery one of the most slippery and yet fundamental aspects of all that modelling and planning is figuring out subsidence or just how fast the louisiana coast is sinking and whether there is anything we can do about it just as katrina struck last year scientists were in the midst of a stormy debate over subsidence twilley recalls rates of subsidence now range from just less than a millimetre per year to times that rate geologists know of at least three things that could be causing the ground to sink lower along louisianas coast one is the extraction of oil gas and water from the ground which was implicated last year in a us geological survey report another is the somewhat limited natural settling and compaction of river sediments that make up the ground lastly there are deeper tectonic changes involving the rising and falling of shifting large blocks of real estate along faults the sort of thing thats more common in faultridden places like california in april twilleys lsu colleague professor roy dokka came out with a paper in geology in which he argued that faulting and what looks like a gigantic slowmoving regional landslide is the cause of almost threequarters of new orleans subsidence dokka revised regional elevation data using precision global positioning system equipment and discovered a higher rate of subsidence over the past years is almost all caused by this tectonic movement then in july geology published a paper by tulane universitys associate professor torbjoumlrn toumlrnqvist who used an entirely different approach toumlrnqvist surveyed longburied wetland peat layers in outlying areas to come up with entirely different and milder subsidence rates i think there is a very balanced dialogue going on says twilley of the two studies i have a lot of respect for both of them its just the way science works agrees reed and its not surprising considering that the two studies are so different in methods and the places they examined she says discovering the truth about subsidence is going to take a lot more work and a great deal of time all of which dokka toumlrnqvist and others are already investing at top speed like the people of the cpr authority the army corps of engineers the levees boards and everyone else along the louisiana coast the subsidence researchers are urgently looking for answers so planners can make the right decisions and everyone can get to work before another katrinasized storm comes anywhere near the problem is says twilley it takes a lot of time and time we dont have an instrument on board this nasa satellite measured simultaneous vertical profiles of ozone and other compounds earths protective ozone layer which was notably thinning in may be fully recovered by midcentury climate scientists say ozone in the stratosphere outside the polar regions stopped thinning in the scientists found after analysing years worth of observations the analysis will be published in the journal of geophysical research atmospheres the ozone layer shields the planet from the suns harmful ultraviolet radiation but humanmade chemicals notably the chlorofluorocarbons found in some refrigerants and aerosol propellants depleted this stratospheric ozone causing the protective layer to get thinner the scientists say the ozone layers comeback is due in large part to compliance with the international montreal protocol which aimed to limit emissions of ozonedepleting chemicals these results confirm the montreal protocol and its amendments have succeeded in stopping the loss of ozone in the stratosphere says dr eunsu yang of the georgia institute of technology who led a team that analysed the data at the current recovery rate the global ozone layer could be restored to levels the time that scientists first noticed the harmful effects human activities were having on atmospheric ozone sometime in the middle of this century yang says researchers from nasa and other agencies reported in june that the socalled ozone hole over antarctica would recover by around which is some years later than previously expected the antarctic ozone hole is a massive loss of ozone that occurs each spring in the southern hemisphere a similar though smaller and less severe ozone hole has been reported in the arctic while ozone is a beneficial shield in the stratosphere some to kilometres above earths surface the ozone encountered at ground level can be damaging to lung tissue and plants and is a major component of smog this supernova indicated by a white arrow was caught exploding in real time astronomers say they have recorded a supernova in real time the death explosion of a massive star that is typically only ever spotted days after the blast in studies that appear today in the journal nature four international teams of astronomers say the extraordinary blast was preceded by a short sharp burst of gamma rays it provides the first confirmation of a theory that supernovae follow an early warning signal of this kind they say supernovae occur when a huge mature star runs out of fuel and catastrophically and explosively collapses in on itself the edge of a blast called the shock breakout is a wave of energy that ranges across the frequency spectrum in february this year an orbiting us sentinel the telescope swift picked up a gammaray burst grb in a starforming galaxy about million lightyears away towards the constellation of aries as it swivelled in the direction of the blast swift also relayed its discovery to major groundbased and spacebased observatories the combined data from their sensors has been pieced together to give a picture about what happened over the next days after a supernova grbs have long been associated with the aftermath of supernovae they are typically huge releases in energy in a few seconds they can spew out more energy than the sun will do in its entire expected lifetime of billion years but this grb was highly unusual it lasted almost minutes whereas a typical grb only lasts a few milliseconds or tens of seconds at the most it was also remarkably weak a mild type of grb known as an xray flash the astronomers believe that this burst was a highenergy jet that pierced through the doomed star from its collapsing core in essence it was sending out a warning that a supernova was imminent suddenly as the grb faded away the massive star blew itself into smithereens sending out a slightly aspherical shockwave that rocketed across the heavens the glowing remains the stars glowing remains were confirmed optically two days later and classified as supernova sn aj usually these events are not detected until after the supernova has brightened substantially in the optical wavelength many days after the initial explosion says professor keith mason chief executive of the uks particle physics and astronomy research council which operates an ultravioletoptical telescope aboard swift but on this occasion we were able to study the remarkable event in all its glory from the very beginning one analysis led by alex filippenko a professor of astronomy at the university of california at berkeley suggests that the star had a mass of about times that of the sun before it blew apart neutron star or black hole the remains of a supernova can become a neutron star a fastrotating star that pulses with high energy alternatively in the case of very massive stars it can form a black hole an object whose gravitational pull is so great that not even light can escape from it supernovae have played in important role in superstition and knowledge a supernova spotted by the danish astronomer tycho brahe in and which lingered for a further months helped overturn the notion established by aristotle that the universe was fixed and unchanging tychos star had such an effect on the popular mind that it reputedly was the inspiration for the celestial omen in shakespeares hamlet warning in a commentary in the journal assistant professor timothy young of the university of north dakota in the us says the research has shown that at least some grbs are warnings of the imminent explosion of massive stars all four papers make clear that the exploding object sent out both a slightly aspherical shockwave typical of a supernova and a jetlike stream of material characteristic of a grb he says molecules that mimic those in plants may be used to create organic solar cells synthetic molecules that mimic chlorophyll in plants may one day form the basis of highly efficient solar cells say australian researchers professor max crossleys molecular electronics group at the university of sydney recently presented its research at the international conference on porphyrins and phthalocyanines in rome nature has evolved this very efficient process over millions of years for harvesting light and then converting it into energy says crossley were trying to mimic aspects of natural photosynthesis dense arrays of chlorophyll molecules in leaves are responsible for converting light energy to electrical energy and then to chemical energy critical to this function of chlorophyll is the pigment porphyrin which is attached to a central magnesium ion crossley and team have made a synthetic form of chlorophyll that performs the first part of that process converting light energy to electrical energy as in nature when a large number of these synthetic molecules are arranged in a dense array they act in concert to efficiently collect photons of light there has to be a lot of them because if there was only one it would be a very inefficient process says crossley soccerballshaped molecules the researchers made a synthetic chlorophyll molecule shaped like a soccer ball it has a dendrimer scaffold a highly branched nanosized polymer made of carbon hydrogen and nitrogen attached to the dendrimer are synthetic versions of the lightharvesting pigment porphyrin spherical carbon molecules called buckyballs sit between the porphyrin and soak up electrons from the photons of collected light crossley and team have used an array of the synthetic chlorophyll to build a prototype of an organic solar cell based on what nature delivers they expect to eventually have much more efficient solar cells than exist at the moment a leaf is about efficient at converting light to electricity and this compares with just a efficiency for conventional siliconbased solar cells we have the basis of a biomimetic organic photovoltaic device or solar cell says crossley in the long term what were trying to do is have something we can simply paint on a roof like a thin layer he says the team also hopes to make storage devices to replace metalbased batteries nano efficiency crossley says conversion of light energy to electrical energy is most efficient when the molecules used to absorb the light are not too large ideally their size is around half the wavelength of the light being absorbed which he says is to nanometres for visible light you cant have a very thick material because light doesnt pass through it says crossley he says there are many groups using nanotechnology to build more efficient solar cells its a very hot topic says crossley so people are endeavouring to use all sorts of novel nanomaterials and ideas in order to achieve high efficiency in the generation of electricity from solar energy team member and postdoctoral researcher dr deanna dalessandro is one of scientists who are presenting their research to the public for the first time under the fresh science initiative anger and hostility may affect hormones that in turn disrupt the immune system causing chronic lung inflammation angry and hostile middleaged men suffer accelerated wear and tear of their lungs a new us study shows in harvard school of public health doctors recruited men aged with the average age of the researchers assessed the doctors hostility using a yardstick test called the cookmedley scale and their lung power determined by the volume of air expelled in a second the volunteers were tested three times over the next years on average after filtering out factors that could distort the result such as smoking and education the researchers found that the mens hostility rating was closely linked to lung capacity they reported the results in the journal thorax those who became more hostile suffered a more rapid decline in lung power than counterparts whose temperament remained unchanged or became more positive every point increase in hostility was associated with a loss of millilitres in the air expulsion test previous research has linked hostility and anger with heart disease asthma hypertension irritable bowel syndrome and other disorders although the exact causes are unclear one theory is that anger and hostility affect hormone processes that in turn disrupt the immune system causing chronic inflammation that damages tissue but dr peter lehrer of the university of medicine and dentistry of new jersey says that an association between hostility and lung function does not necessarily equate to cause personality as well as physiology can change over time and deterioration in health and physical function can lead to negative emtions as well as vice versa including for respiratory disease he writes in a commentary in the same issue of the journal some women with normal pregnancies have caesareans as a matter of choice while it is rare for women in developed countries to die from childbirth a new french study has found caesarean delivery more than triples the risk the findings are from a study led by dr catherine deneuxtharaux of the maternite hopital tenon in paris published in the september issue of obstetrics gynecology this study shows that caesarean delivery is associated with a threefold increase in the risk of postpartum maternal death as compared with vaginal delivery the researchers say there has been a continuous rise in the rate of caesareans in developed countries and some professionals have recently proposed elective caesarean delivery should be an acceptable firstchoice method of delivery for women with normal pregnancy say deneuxtharaux and colleagues but they say the increased risk of maternal death needs to be taken into account by clinicians and women when balancing risks and benefits of vaginal versus caesarean delivery deneuxtharaux and team looked at maternal deaths that occurred between and and that were reported to a french confidential enquiry on maternal deaths they compared these to a control group of women selected from the french national perinatal survey all of the deaths followed births of a single child and were not due to conditions existing prior to delivery the women had also not been hospitalised during pregnancy the researchers found that the risk of death from blood clots infection or complications from anaesthesia was times higher for women who had caesareans the risk of death after childbirth was increased whether or not the caesarean was performed before the onset of labour or during labour the researchers say previous studies of the relationship between caesarean delivery and risk of maternal death have reported inconsistent results our objectives in this study were to provide a valid estimate of the risk they say although rates of maternal death in most developed countries are relatively low in the us women have a in chance of pregnancyrelated death the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists say the incidence of maternal mortality has not significantly decreased in the last two decades but deneuxtharaux and team say there is persistent underidentification of maternal mortality in developed countries a recent study found a underreporting of maternal deaths in vital statistics from france they say could tinkering with the dna of immune cells be a cure for deadly cancers two out of patients with a deadly form of skin cancer have had their tumours wiped out by genetically altered immune cells us researchers report but while the findings are being hailed as evidence that the troubled field of gene therapy can successfully treat cancer other experts say the results are disappointing dr steven rosenberg of the us national cancer institute nci and colleagues report their findings today online ahead of print publication in the journal science the technique represents the first time that gene manipulations have been shown to cause tumour regression in humans rosenberg says the researchers infused patients suffering from metastatic melanoma with their own white blood cells that had been removed and genetically engineered to fight tumours the patients tcells had been modified with genes that code for receptors designed to recognise melanoma cells the cancer was eliminated in two male patients the researchers say in one case a yearold man had a tumour in his armpit disappear and another on his liver shrunk enough to be surgically removed he remained diseasefree months after treatment the study says another patient a yearold man had a lung tumour recede and showed no signs of disease months later the tumours went away and both of the patients are now completely diseasefree over a year and a half later says rosenberg who is chief of surgery at the nci before the experiment the patients had advanced skin cancer that was not helped by standard therapies and they were expected to live just three to six months he says disappointing response but the cancers in the remaining patients did not respond to the treatment and other gene therapy researchers say the results may be a step forward but are no cause for celebration this certainly is a significant technical advance that is going to fuel more interest and more enthusiasm i hope among researchers says dr michel sadelain director of memorial sloankettering cancer centers somatic cell engineering laboratory but he adds it is undeniable the response here is rather disappointing professor savio woo of mount sinai school of medicine and a past president of the american society of gene therapy says the researchers need to do it in more patients and get better response rates and when that happens we can all pop the champagne scientists have touted gene therapy as holding great promise for a range of ailments but safety problems have set the field back one experiment cured two french bubble boys with a rare immune disorder but later gave them leukaemia and an yearold died in a gene therapy experiment rosenberg says there are no side effects from the melanoma gene therapy it was administered with the drug interleukin which can cause fluid retention he says the researchers hope the same approach can fight breast lung and other cancers and are seeking regulatory approval to test the technology in other patients the new spaceships are meant to replace the space shuttle fleet to be retired in europes first probe to the moon crashed into the lunar surface at the weekend giving stargazers around the world an astronomical fireworks display scientists hope that dust kicked up by the impact of the european space agency esa probe will tell them more about the moons origin the smart probe smashed into a plain called the lake of excellence on the southwestern side of the moons face producing a more intense flash than expected says the missions chief scientist professor bernard foing the craft plunged to the surface at a speed of kilometres per second throwing up a cloud of dust esa estimates that the impact would leave a crater measuring metres in diameter and metre deep over the past three years operating with a fulltime staff of just seven and a total budget equivalent to us million dollars the little probe has been testing new technology that one day could help put humans on mars scientists also say that the detailed photos transmitted by the craft will yield a fresh look at the moon revealing earths satellite as a place of surprising complexity and promise rather than a lifeless rock with little to offer except grey dust smart is the vanguard of future space missions says the crafts operations manager octavio caminoramos almost everything on board was innovative it was a mission to test technology the science was an extra plus ion thruster an ion thruster engine has propelled the cube which measured just metre across and weighed kilograms since it was launched in september the engine type has only been used once before with the us craft deep space launched in to rendezvous with an asteroid and then a comet ion engines are fuelled by xenon gas the gas atoms are charged by electric guns powered by solar panels and are then expelled from the rear of the spacecraft delivering a tiny thrust visible as a ghostly blue glow chemical engines burn out after a couple of minutes whereas an ion engine can push on gently for months or even years for so long as the sun shines and the small supply of propellant lasts smart travelled million kilometres but used just kilograms litres of fuel an extraordinary feat in space exploration standards but unlike the deep space missions essentially straightline trajectories smart had to carry out a complex series of manoeuvres to slowly but relentlessly build up speed it had to loop again and again around the earth to gain extra speed yet also juggle with the moons gravitational tug all the time using a tiny engine that delivered the same power as someone picking up an a sheet of paper camino says the experience was an adventure and compared it to navigating a small sailboat buffeted by swirling winds and currents but the tiny thruster needed months for a trip that took apollo only three days we have shown that ion propulsion works camino says predicting that this will be the thruster of choice for two esa missions in the next decade bepicolombo to explore mercury and solar orbiter which will swoop close to the sun and it is also likely to be the propulsion for hauling big cargo containers to the moon to help build the first lunar settlement or to mars to support the first manned mission there he says small package other smart innovations are a new communications system newgeneration solar panels and a package of sensors and scanners that foing hails as a miracle of miniaturisation seven instruments weighing just kilos weighing as little as a th of conventional instruments carried aboard space probes smarts xray telescope and infrared spectrometer have been carrying out the most detailed map of the moons elements and minerals says foing smart has also sought out locations at the lunar poles that are in permanent shade and could be worth exploring if as some scientists hope water exists on the moon or just below its surface your genes only account for of your personality so dont blame your parents genes shape our health and appearance more than they shape our personality suggests a new study of thousands of people in a genetically isolated part of the world according to the study published in the august issue of plos genetics genetics account for roughly of a persons height weight and body shape of cardiovascular function and about of certain blood characteristics such as sugar and cholesterol levels but genes only account for about of many documented personality traits such as neuroticism extraversion agreeableness and conscientiousness my personal view is that we have evolved to have very diverse personalities and that compared to other traits personality may be much less deterministic than other human characteristics says associate professor gonccedilalo abecasis one of the studys authors my view is that both genes and environment will play smaller roles than random factors abecasis a scientist at the center for statistical genetics at the university of michigan and his colleagues examined people from the mediterranean island of sardinia where many residents are related roughly of people in the study had sardinian grandparents and the test group included pairs of siblings the researchers believe their study is the largest ever published for the traits they examined the scientists took blood samples gave physical exams and asked participants to fill out standard personality questionnaires they also measured liver and thyroid function electrolyte levels cholesterol blood glucose and more shared dna to figure out the degree to which each trait was affected by genetics the researchers first calculated the amount of dna shared by each pair of relatives for example the dna of identical twins is almost identical siblings average similarity and unclenephew pairs usually have about similarity cousins share on average about of their dna the researchers then compared this information with the health weight personality and other data computer models matched these traits with relatedness to find how much of each trait appeared to be affected by genetics while the study found genetic effects often determine whether a person will be heavy or thin the researchers say we cannot always blame our genes for weight problems dr david schlessinger who also worked on the study and is a senior scientist at the national institute on aging says that lifestyle has led to the current epidemic of obesity it does appear however that some individuals have a genetic constitution that is more resistant to the modern diet and lifestyle than others schlessinger adds personality and disease crossexamination of all of the data revealed that personality traits do not appear to be linked to blood and heart health for example angerprone people dont appear to suffer more heart problems than mellow people do what is unusual about the study is its size and integration of a large amount of trait information into the analysis says dr wayne frankel senior staff scientist at the jackson laboratory in maine it is important that the heritability of related traits be considered together in order to improve the power of geneidentification experiments in future abecasis and his colleagues next hope to identify the particular genes that are responsible for each of the traits they studied brain chemicals that make you restless and fidgety may also play a role in keeping you lean a researcher believes thin peoples brains may be more sensitive to a naturally occurring chemical that makes them wriggle jiggle and fidget through the day an international obesity conference will hear us researcher associate professor catherine kotz from the minneapolis veterans affairs medical center and the university of minnesota will present her research on the neuropeptide orexina at an international obesity conference in sydney this week previous research has shown that orexina which was only discovered in the last decade makes us burn energy by stimulating unconscious activity like fidgeting and restlessness kotz says her study published online in the american journal of physiology shows orexina affects activity in rats when injected into their brains we injected orexina into normal rats and it caused increased movement she says when we inject it into lean rats theyre very sensitive to it they really increase their movement the obese rats dont seem to respond so that said to us there is some difference in the orexina signalling in their brains underpants study kotzs research grew out of an earlier study by dr james levine of the mayo clinic in his study levine put lean and fat people into underwear with builtin sensors that gauged their movement through the day that research published in the journal science last year found that lean people spend an average two hours more a day than their obese counterparts doing unconscious spontaneous movements such as lifting their arms jigging a foot or getting up and down what he found is that lean individuals move for two hours more per day than obese individuals she says this is activity that was not going to the gym not exercising the fidgeters burnt about kilocalories a day through this nonspecific movement the equivalent of a minute brisk walk orexina on the brain when kotzs team did brain scans on their orexina enhanced rats they found that the lean rats had about double the number of orexina receptors than the obese rats suggesting its sensitivity rather than quantity that counts the difference in receptor number could be because of genetic programming or changes produced by over or under stimulation during life she says this question is the subject of further study kotz says while the rat study hasnt been done in humans our brains also produce orexina she says her findings could eventually lead to an antiobesity treatment such as a patch that either increased the number of brains orexina receptors or boost the sensitivity of existing ones a wide variety of food helps brushtail possums eat and eat without overloading their bodies with toxins brushtail possums can tell when theyve eaten too much of their favourite snacks according to new research revealing their uncanny ability to regulate what goes into their mouths unlike humans who can pig out on chocolate or hot chips until we make ourselves sick possums know exactly when theyre starting to overload their system with toxins says researcher dr karen marsh of the australian national university theyre really good at regulating their intake and knowing exactly how much they can eat she says of the marsupial herbivores marsh reports in a recent issue of the journal ecology that the common brushtail possum trichosurus vulpecula thrives when it eats a wide variety of foods rather than a limited range the reasons for this have been unclear in the past but marsh says her study supports one of the leading theories which suggests that possums are better able to neutralise small amounts of naturally occurring toxins from a variety of foods than a hightoxin load from a single food food toxins because of its plantbased diet the brushtail possum eats foods that not only contain nutrients but potentially toxic byproducts it neutralises these in various ways for example by oxidising the toxins or converting them into different molecules if the possum only eats one food it will reach the threshold for that particular toxin faster than if it selects from a wider smorgasbord basically they seem to be able to recognise whether toxins are similar or different and feed accordingly marsh says what we think happens is that the toxins activate the emetic pathways in the body so the possums start to feel sick when their detox pathways get saturated getting rid of toxins marsh tested the hypothesis by identifying various toxin thresholds in the possums and working out how each was eliminated by analysing metabolites in their urine she then offered the possums a range of foods with similar toxin pathways and a range of foods with different pathways she found the possums ate less when the foods activated similar pathways marsh says its important to understand the mechanisms that regulate diet in possums because it can help in their conservation we want to know what sort of habitat is going to be suitable for them she says can they survive in a habitat thats been degraded and only has one type of plant or do they really need that mix so they can be swapping between the different plants she says humans should have the same responses to food toxins but most toxic metabolites have been eliminated from our food making us more prone to overeating kandinskys improvisation sea battle looks good but how does it sound the expressionist painter wassily kandinsky wanted people to not only see his paintings but to hear them says a neuroscientist and expert in the condition known as synaesthesia dr jamie ward a british neuroscientist at university college london ucl says the russianborn french artist knew about synaesthesia a sensory phenomenon in which one sense can trigger another for example synaesthetes report being able to taste music see sounds or hear images what kandinsky wanted to do was for it to appeal to hearing as well ward said during a symposium at the british association for the advancement of science festival of science kandinsky wanted to make visual art more like music more abstract he also hoped that his paintings would be heard by his audiences for example one synaesthete described a kandinsky painting as having a huge splurge of sound booming and vulgar a mousy little meee sound that translates into ohs and ahs and shapes that pop up laughing with a whooo ward says its unknown whether kandinsky experienced synaesthesia himself but the artist certainly knew about the phenomenon he says linking vision and sound synaesthetes make up only about one or two in every hundred people but ward believes we all link vision and sound unconsciously and we tend to agree on which images match which sounds however only a tiny minority of us is aware of the crossover in our senses he hypothesised that most people would be able to link an image by someone with synaesthesia to a particular piece of music upon which the image was based to test the theory ward conducted a series of experiments where he asked synaesthetes to draw and describe their vision of music played by the new london orchestra we played them musical notes and got them to draw and describe what they see ward says a control group without synaesthesia did the same and a professional artist created animations of the images related to the music when more than people were shown images and asked to choose the animations that best suited the music they consistently selected the images from the synaesthetes its almost as if everybody can appreciate these synaesthetic images even if they dont have synaesthesia he says although information from the world enters our heads via different sensory organs once they are in the brain they are intimately connected in nonrandom ways synaesthesia which runs in families is present from birth but not much is known about what actually causes it ward says studying synaesthesia will help scientists understand how senses and thoughts are linked in out brains he says the next stage of his research will use brain scans to monitor what happens when synaethetes are shown a kandinsky painting a woman places flowers at the entrance to australia zoo after its conservationist patron steve irwin or the crocodile hunter died from a stingrays barb to the heart on monday in death as in life iconic tv naturalist steve irwin captivated millions worldwide and clogged the internet as fans from around the world reacted with disbelief to news the crocodile hunter was dead some websites groaned to a halt within hours of the first reports on monday that irwin had been killed by a stingrays barb through his chest in a freak diving accident off australias northeast coast web measurement company hitwise says irwins death was the biggest news event read by australians on the internet since two australian miners were trapped by a mine collapse in southern tasmania state in late april we noticed that the website wwwcrocodilehuntercom increased in popularity quite substantially it became the number one entertainment personality website in australia yesterday and in the us it also became the third most popular says a spokesperson for hitwise asiapacific australian news websites struggled to keep up with demand the abcs site had to temporarily shut down posting a notice on monday that it was experiencing higher than normal traffic it resumed soon after in a lowbandwidth format to cope with hundreds of thousands of hits newspaper websites also wobbled but kept up with demand a spokesperson for the sydney morning herald says its website experienced a spike in page impressions compared with the previous weeks average weekday number of about there was also a jump in visitors to its pages the spokesperson says that pattern was mirrored around the world with irwins death leading major news websites such as cnn and us and uk newspaper websites as well as swamping their most viewed and most emailed categories blogs and internet feedback pages were also awash with postings from shocked readers from around the world many of them from americans charmed by irwins quirky style and his catchphrase crikey a snapshot within a proton showing a strange quark red and its antistrange partner yellow together with two up quarks blue and a down quark green scientists say theyve solved a decadeold puzzle about the enigmatic strange quark one of the fundamental building blocks of matter their findings published recently in the journal physical review letters help put our understanding of the universe on a more solid footing associate professor derek leinweber from the university of adelaide and colleagues used a combination of supercomputing and physics to study the oddly named particle strange quarks are one of six different flavours of quark that combine to form protons and neutrons two of the main components of atoms the others are known as up down charm top and bottom quarks the shortlived strange quark is the most mysterious of them all leinweber says it boils up inside the positively charged proton and then simmers back out of existence he says scientists have long pondered exactly how the strange quark contributes to the distribution of charge in the proton leinweber says people have been playing around with these problems for years or more by combining results from reallife experiments with simulations the adelaide team with collaborators at the university of edinburgh and the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility in the us says it has calculated the strange contribution with unprecedented accuracy those calculations predict that the shortlived strange quarks display an unanticipated level of symmetry in their journey its a bit of a surprise leinweber says there was some idea that the strange quark would be distributed asymmetrically effective field theory the research brought together expertise in supercomputing with techniques in a branch of physics called effective field theory leinweber says these are two separate areas which have been used together in a way that noone else has thought of for the physics world the findings could have major implications particularly as experimental results coming from labs around the world are already beginning to confirm the theories of the australian researchers now scientists are considering how to incorporate the results into research at enormous particle accelerator facilities like the large hadron collider buried underground at cern in switzerland our result presents a huge challenge to experimental physicists in planning the next generation of experiments says leinweber billions of dollars are going to be spent based on this result ultimately the research is helping scientists understand the universe in greater detail than ever before leinweber says its putting our current understanding of our world on a solid foundation an inner ear as you have never seen it before university of sydneys key centre for microscopy and microanalysis will report its findings in the journal acta otolaryngologica the scientists revealed the detailed structure of the inner ear from a guinea pig using a new method called xray microtomography its ct computed tomography scanning for microscopy basically a ct scanner for a microscope says jones like hospital ct scanning the method images internal structures in d using xrays structures like bones absorb more xrays and are more visible than those that absorb less the d image is built up by taking a series of slices of the solid object but xray microtomography can take many more slices that a hospital ct scanner this provides much higher resolution allowing scientists to image the delicately thin structures of the inner ear the image the scientists generated shows the stapes red the saccular macula yellow and the utricular macula blue it also shows the coils of the cochlea and the fluidfilled semicircular canals that help an animal keep balance this structure is actually embedded in the most dense bone in the body the temporal bone and normal hospital medical ct doesnt have enough resolution to see these says jones secrets of an ancient eyeball one of the first studies jones was involved in that used the new technique was the imaging of millionyearold fossilised fish eyeballs the project carried out with palaeontologist dr carole burrow from the university of queensland was the first use of xray microtomography to investigate small vertebrate fossils methane bubbles trapped in lake ice in october fears that retreating permafrost is accelerating climate change have been strengthened by a new study that says emissions of the greenhouse gas methane are soaring in northern siberia in a complex cycle permafrost melts at the edges of lakes that previously were iced over yearround according to the research led by dr katey walter of the university of alaska at fairbanks organic material the remains of rotted plants and longdead animals then subsides into the lake from the soil slides to the lake bottom and decomposes to form methane eventually during a thaw this methane bubbles to the surface and is released into the atmosphere in the first major study into the bubbling phenomenon or ebullition walters team believes that current estimates of methane released from wetlands between latitudes and deg north should be upgraded by ebullition from siberian thaw lakes is a large and increasing source of atmospheric methane as siberian thaw lakes continue to expand warns the study published today in the journal nature between and a period that matches figures for local warming the spread of thaw lakes caused methane emissions in siberia to rise by it says the greenhouse gas methane comes from natural sources such as agriculture decomposing vegetation and marshland one worry is what scientists called a positive feedback from billions of tonnes of stored methane that is locked in the ground and under frozen lakes in canada and siberia this scenario in essence is a vicious circle scientists say global warming warms up the permafrost which releases the trapped methane and this in turn adds to the greenhouse effect volume for volume methane is times more effective at trapping solar heat respectively than carbon dioxide by itself methane accounts for a fifth of the manmade greenhouse effect of the past years scientists say playing against other gamers may help to build informal connections and expose people to multiple world views gaming can be a sociable experience according to a new study that questions the myth of the lone gamer sitting at the computer disconnected from society the us study says games involving multiple players can act like informal gathering places like pubs and coffee shops so can boost the players social connections assistant professor constance steinkuehler of the university of wisconsinmadison and assistant professor dmitri williams of the university of illinois at urbanachampaign looked at people playing socalled massively multiplayer online games mmos by providing spaces for social interaction and relationships beyond the workplace and home mmos have the capacity to function as one form of a new third space for informal sociability the researchers write while such sociability wont offer deep emotional support they add it has the benefit of exposing players to a wide range of viewpoints and a more diverse social environment the effects of the internet on society are still being debated the researchers note in an article in the journal of computermediated communication some say it allows people to build connections and communities while others say such virtual links are just a poor substitute for the real thing the researchers sought to investigate the role of mmos in which players inhabit avatars or onscreen representations of characters within virtual worlds and chat with other players by text or voice in players social lives they studied whether one game asherons call i and ii built players social capital by dividing people into gameplaying and nonplaying groups they also conducted a twoyear study of the activities and perceptions of a group of people playing the game lineage steinkuehler and williams conclude that the games helped players gather a type of social capital known as bridging which involves making informal connections with others while they didnt generally help people build stronger social bonds such weaker social links are important the researchers say because they offer players the opportunity to be exposed to diverse world views that they may not encounter in the real world but players who did become more deeply involved in the games did run the risk of having virtual relationships replace reallife ones the researchers note however to see these online communities as an entirely bad thing is shortsighted they say to argue that mmo game play is isolated and passive media consumption in place of informal social engagement is to ignore the nature of what participants actually do behind the computer screen they state in the case of mmos game play is more akin to playing fiveperson poker in a neighbourhood tavern that is accessible from your own living room chimp or lollipop man dominant chimps look both ways to see if the roads clear before shepherding other chimps across adult male chimpanzees act like school lollipop men by leading smaller chimps across roads that dissect their forest habitats according to a new study the finding demonstrates that chimps display concern for family and friends and will risk their own safety to ensure the welfare of others scientists now believe such ability for care and consideration is present in certain primates and not just humans i think that we would definitely see this kind of behaviour in other great ape species and different populations may reveal cultural differences in protective orderings says kimberley hockings lead author of the study which is published in the journal current biology hockings a researcher at the university of stirling in scotland and colleagues observed a group of wild chimps in bossou guinea west africa the chimp group consisted of three adult males five adult females three juveniles and one infant two roads dissect the chimps forest homeland the first is a narrow road used by pedestrians while the second is wider and carries trucks motorbikes cars as well as pedestrians the scientists analysed instances where the chimpanzees crossed the two roads in each instance an adult male often the alpha male named yolo would stand at the edge of the road he then would carefully look left and right then motion with an arm at that point the other chimps formed themselves into an ordered line and followed behind the order nearly always consisted of adult males first with females juveniles and the infant second the leader or another adult male would then wait at the end of the line to assist the littlest ones when crossing the heavier traffic road the second ranked male foaf would continue to scan for vehicles and people while the elderly third male tua and the alpha female took the lead the researchers noted that the female would move into the more forward leader position when the degree of crossing risk increased they tend to travel in such ordered lines in risky situations such as road crossing and crop raiding says hockings depending on the situation when moving through the forest it is much more common that the chimpanzees are spread out dr klaus zuberbuumlhler is a university of st andrews scientist who conducts research on the cognitive capacities of nonhuman primates the scotlandbased scientist calls the findings amazing whats perhaps most striking is that kimberlys research shows that these freeranging chimpanzees are not indifferent to the welfare of other group members in contrast to previous findings reported from captive chimpanzees zuberbuumlhler says they appear to have an understanding of other group members vulnerability and they take action in response to this knowledge it also highlights the importance of studying the cognitive capacities of primates in the wild the majority of research on chimpanzee intelligence is currently conducted in highly deprived lab situations and perhaps unsurprisingly individuals often show little or no interest in engaging in cooperative or altruistic acts hockings hopes future research will determine similar progression orders in other great ape populations which could reveal how human social organisation probably emerged in our distant primate ancestors the coral reef pygmy goby eviota sigillata swims its way into the record books life on the great barrier reef is fast and furious for the coral reef pygmy goby the worlds shortestliving fish whose entire existence lasts no longer than two months the pygmy gobys recordbreaking status was confirmed this week by guinness world records not only is it the fastest living fish it has the shortest life span of any creature with a backbone known to science the tiny fish spend their first three weeks as larvae in the open ocean before they settle on the reef they then mature within two weeks and have a maximum adult lifespan of just three and a half weeks says professor david bellwood from james cook university and arc centre of excellence for coral reef studies in total they live days and thats the maximum bellwood says its like taking a year old woman and saying thats how long humans live most of them dont make it there bellwood and his colleague martial depczynski first reported the gobys remarkable life span in the journal current biology last year and then submitted it to guiness for world record scrutiny they figured out the life span of the fish by examining small bones in their ears called otoliths which grow as they age each day pygmy gobies lay down a new ring in their otoliths much as a tree does for each year bellwood says the results were a complete surprise we were just stunned bellwood says we thought at first it must have been a mistake but we went back again and again and confirmed it pygmy gobies eviota sigillata are found on the great barrier reef and other reefs in the pacific and indian oceans during their threeweeks of sexual maturity the fish produce just three clutches of eggs to help ensure they survive the male goby stands guard fanning the eggs with his fins while they are incubating the fast and furious lifestyle of the fish is probably an evolutionary response to the fact that they have so many predators on the reef the scientists say for small species living in places where their life expectancy is low evolution often favours a live fast die young strategy its just a case of reproduce like mad before you die says bellwood common brown snakes like this one surprised the scientists by producing higher levels of venom than anyone had seen before australian snakes are delivering more venom than we realise according to researchers who say this may force us to rethink how we treat snakebites the poisonous australian brown snake is one of the surprise packages producing what lead researcher peter mirtschin describes as spectacular yields of venom mirtschin managing director of the company venom supplies and adjunct research fellow at the university of south australia and colleagues publish their findings online in the journal ecotoxicology dr bryan grieg fry of the australian venom research unit at the university of melbourne says the study is of huge importance particularly in relation to brown snakes and current antivenom guidelines the findings have huge clinical implications the brown snake is the most common cause of snakebite in australia and the most common cause of death by snakebite in australia says fry who wasnt involved in the research the key to antivenom is to get it in early and to get in the proper amounts a big amount given early means less overall total as well as a better clinical outcome these findings can dramatically influence the amount of antivenom needed he says the findings are definitely strong enough to change clinical practice in australia milking snakes the researchers milked dangerous species of snakes native and nonnative to australia numerous times over a sixyear period from to then they averaged the yield or the average amount of venom a snake produces when it is milked by each snake type the team found that snakes from the pseudonaja genus including the queensland and south australian common brown snake yielded higher than previously published amounts of venom in certain individuals we found quite spectacular yields if you had a bite by one of those youd be in real trouble says mirtschin higher percentage solids were also obtained from venoms from four cobra species from the naja genus and the pseudechis king brown genus snake venom comprises salts water enzymes proteins and other macromolecular and smaller organic and inorganic compounds venom yield is traditionally measured and compared in its dried powder form where the water is removed leaving the remaining solids the findings have led researchers to call for a rethink on current volumes and dosages of antivenom serums if you are giving antivenom then maybe the vial size of the antivenom should be increased or at least the number of vials that are recommended as the initial dose be increased mirtschin says when the researchers asked the woman to imagine she was playing tennis her brain scan lit up in virtually the same places as the brains of healthy volunteers asked to do the same thing brain scans of a woman who has been in a vegetative state for five months show her imagining playing tennis and responding to commands researchers report they say their study published today in the journal science shows the woman was conscious despite her comalike state although several experts disagree the researchers stress that the study is unlikely to shed light on issues such as the case of terri schiavo a florida woman who spent years in a persistent vegetative state and was allowed to die in march after a long court battle dr adrian owen a neuroscientist at the university of cambridge and colleagues in the uk and belgium used functional magnetic resonance imaging or fmri to look at the womans brain in action the yearold woman who was injured in a car accident had been unresponsive unable to communicate and met the clinical criteria for a vegetative state the researchers say they looked at her brain function when listening to sentences such as there was milk and sugar in his coffee the brain scan lit up in very similar ways to those seen in healthy volunteers owens team found the researchers then asked the woman to imagine certain acts one task involved imagining playing a game of tennis and the other involved imagining visiting all of the rooms of her house starting from the front door the researchers write her scan lit up in virtually the same places as the brains of the healthy volunteers asked to do the same thing these results confirm that this patient retained the ability to understand spoken commands and to respond to them through her brain activity rather than through speech or movement the researchers write she also clearly intended to cooperate which confirmed beyond any doubt that she was consciously aware of herself and her surroundings they write this is unlikely the case for all vegetative patients owens team cautions in its report experts note the woman had relatively little brain damage and say traumatic brain injury often heals better than injury caused by stroke or heart attack such as schiavo suffered schiavo also had been in her state for far longer than the uk woman allowing for severe deterioration of her brain dr ross zafonte a brain rehabilitation expert at the university of pittsburgh school of medicine says the study shows a unique way of assessing brain function using scans they raise a whole issue regarding consciousness and how we use this term zafonte says is she just a rare bird will we see this on a more common basis other brain experts are sceptical if this patient is actually conscious why wouldnt she be able to engage in intentional overt motor acts given that she had not suffered functional or structural lesion of the motor pathways asks dr lionel naccache of frances inserm research institute in a commentary published with the report he says the patient apparently has a rich mental life including auditory language processing and the ability to perform mental imagery tasks the study points to a need to develop better scans to assess a patients brain status naccache says dr paul matthews a neuroscientist at imperial college london and university of oxford says the study does not demonstrate consciousness response to stimuli even complex linguistic stimuli does not provide evidence of a decision to respond withdrawal from an unexpected painful pin prick does not represent a decision to respond he says could hydrogen sulfide gas from the river have killed dr bogle and mrs chandler new evidence may support the idea that rotten egg gas from a polluted river was to blame for two of the most mysterious deaths in australian history evidence aired in an abc tv documentary this week suggests a concentrated cloud of hydrogen sulfide killed physicist dr gilbert bogle and mrs margaret chandler but some toxicologists remain sceptical that the gas was behind the deaths of the two lovers whose bodies were found by the banks of sydneys lane cover river in at the time some suspected they were killed by a rapidly acting poison yet the investigation which included help from the fbi and new scotland yard could find no cause of death motive or killer many suspected margaret chandlers husband geoffrey but the documentary who killed dr bogle and mrs chandler resurrects the hydrogen sulfide theory a notion first discounted by police investigators in according to the theory hydrogen sulfide bubbling up from the river mud in the still early morning air had became trapped in a hollow where the lovers lay in embrace the gas had come mainly from industrial waste that had been dumped into the river over the past years and hydrogen sulfide from sewage in the river us forensic toxicologist dr thomas milby told the filmmaker that hydrogen sulfide gas can be fatal in high doses and his reading of the autopsy reports convinced him the gas was the culprit the probabilities were that it was an inhaled gas as opposed to a pill or something like that he says milby also commented on analyses of blood samples taken from the two victims during the investigations these found a bluish tinge in both samples which he says supports the hydrogen sulfide theory i saw nothing in either report that would in my opinion exclude the possibility of hydrogen sulfide as being the culprit that killed them sceptical but at least two australian experts are not so sure about the theory as a healthy sceptic id say interesting theory but why didnt they smell the gas because its pretty disgusting says forensic pathologist dr christopher lawrence who is with the tasmanian health department also were the tests taken in a way that you could rely on the results he says while hydrogen sulfide could discolour the blood by interacting with haemoglobin any blood tests would needed to have been carried out very shortly after the deaths wreaths laid for steve irwin who died from a stingrays barb to the heart while filming a documentary in north queensland this weeks mass grieving in response to the death of australian crocodile hunter steve irwin is part of a fairly recent phenomenon dependent on the mass media say experts but how do we make sense of this public grieving for the loss of someone most have never met we generally think of grief as being associated with the loss of people were very close to like a family member says psychologist grant brecht of the australian psychological society but he says we can feel close to someone we have never met if we come to know and like them through their appearances in the media we conjure up in our own mind feelings and thoughts about what that person would be like says brecht and when they die we respond as if we did in fact know them we can experience grief almost at the same level as we may well do with a family member says brecht people would have felt an affinity with steve he says he was a bit of an australian icon a bit of an australian larrikin someone who seemed to have quite an affinity with animals which most of us would respect brecht says the mourning is a healthy part of dealing with the feeling of loss while most of us will remember the spontaneous outpourings exhibited after the death of princess diana grieving hasnt always been such a public affair a recent phenomenon australian national university historian professor pat jalland says mass public grieving has really only taken off since the s had the equivalent of princess diana died years earlier i can guarantee it would not have resulted in anything like what happened she says jalland says the last period in history when grieving was an accepted activity was during the th century before the advent of mass media at this time death claimed many infant lives and grieving occurred through religious rituals but between and the s public grieving was suppressed says jalland in part this was helped by a decline in infant mortality which meant death mainly happened in old age and behind closed doors at home and eventually in hospital silence about death the suppression of grief was also helped by a decline in religious ritual and by a period of major wars in which soldiers and by implication all of us were expected to bear death with stoicism says jalland the two world wars created a massive overload of death and sorrow which induced what freud and others call death denial a silence about death she says the emotional responses were suppressed at this time media coverage of sudden and tragic deaths were very factual and lacked the personal stories that are common today says jalland but she says all that changed in the s when there was a huge cultural shift towards more open displays of emotion this shift was encouraged by the womens and gay liberation movements says jalland and by psychologists like elisabeth kublerross who encouraged open discussion about death and dying and it was encouraged by the mass media which showed grief as a normal response to tragedy by reporting the personal stories of those involved secular spirituality dr david ritchie of deakin university who has a special interest in grief education says the good side of mass media facilitated grief is that it gives people permission to grieve he says this is important in a society where people seldom die at home there are few rituals around death and peoples main experience of death is through the media the idea of death as part of the life cycle is really foreign says ritchie who is also on the management committee of the australian centre for grief and bereavement ritchie says spontaneous outpourings of grief in the company of strangers helps people make sense of the shocking nature of sudden death making shrines out of flowers photos artwork and poetry lighting candles and sharing stories about the person who has died all helps to make people feel connected and empowered says ritchie its part of a secular spirituality but ritchie doesnt see mass public grieving as anything like the grief of a close family member we can always see steve irwin by looking at the films he says we can always press the rewind button or put the tape back in again because thats how we knew him it will be very different for his family says ritchie and he says each person experiences grief differently and the one size fits all version sanctioned by the mass media could lead to inauthentic experiences of grief most people who had died from bird flu virus in the vietnamese study had the virus in their blood suggesting it could have been transported out of the respiratory tract the hn bird flu virus replicates far more aggressively in people than common human flu viruses a study of patients in vietnam has found offering further insight as to why the virus is so deadly the study published online in the journal nature medicine also found that the virus gets into the blood stream of many of the humans it kills which means the virus can spread to other parts of the body dr menno de jong of the oxford university clinical research unit at vietnams hospital for tropical diseases in ho chi minh city says that the unusually high viral loads trigger intense cytokine responses an immune system overreaction that can be fatal cytokines are proteins in the immune system that fight off intruders such as bacteria and viruses during hn infection the cytokine response seems to be very very intense cytokines want to get rid of this intruder but if you have very high levels of cytokines it can also damage the body it can be directed against your own cells and organs says de jong the study involved people infected with hn and eight with human flu in and in vietnam scientists found far higher viral loads in the nose and throats of those infected with bird flu than human flu thirteen of those infected with hn died and the virus was found in the blood of at least nine of them suggesting it could have been transported out of the respiratory tract the virus was also found in the rectums of most of those with hn suggesting it could have spread through the blood stream into the gastrointestinal tract those with common flu had no virus in their blood or rectum no one died in that group the fatal outcome of hn infections seems to be associated with high levels of replication of the virus and also the detection of the virus in the blood says de jong the team was able to draw a connection between those who were most ill and the level of cytokines found in them we found that levels of cytokines were much higher in hn patients than in the human flu cases again the highest levels of cytokines were found in those who died of hn he says the high levels of the virus triggered an overwhelming inflammatory response that contributed to lung dysfunction and eventual death de jong highlights the need to stop the virus replicating whats important is to stop the replication as soon as possible so you prevent damage to the lungs and prevent the inflammatory response to the virus he says but he says that early diagnosis is a challenge especially in remote places where health services are not readily available could graffiti be a sign of something more serious than teen rebellion teens who get involved in graffiti tagging may be showing early symptoms of a personality disorder an australian psychiatrist says professor graham martin director of child and adolescent psychiatry at the university of queensland and colleagues studied more than people aged he says the study presented at an international child and adolescent mental health conference in melbourne this week found that teens who graffiti are significantly different to those who do not graffiti they satisfy the criteria for conduct disorder and or delinquency and later down the track a number of these young people go on to antisocial behaviour personality disorder he says these young people were very antisocial on a range of other factors they werent just mildly conduct disordered they were scoring to the extreme range of antisocial behaviour martin says the findings of the study show that conventional methods of handling young graffiti offenders such as dealing with them under the legal system are doomed to failure but he says the good news is that with intensive individual family and community therapy its possible to put people back on track graffiti may be one gateway into working with young people to assist them to find a new direction he says it may be extending their creative skills or just sitting down with them and saying listen youve had a bit of a shit life havent you subtexts of graffiti martin says tagging conveys a number of messages from saying hello im here to being a territorial marker and an expression of rage against authority he says the study found adolescent graffitists had done around six to eight other acts such as setting fires beating people up and stealing they also had higher rates of drug use academic failure physical and sexual abuse depression anxiety and suicidal thoughts of the teenagers studied about of boys and almost of girls had done some graffiti it may even be possible to pick a future graffitist martin says underlining the importance of early intervention you can pick many of these young people somewhere around the age of three he says the average kindergarten teacher will tell you i dont like that child i cant work with them they spit at me they spit at the other kids they hit people they wont learn you can certainly predict which ones will go on to antisocial behaviour and within that graffiti is going to be one of the things that stands out one critic is concerned that the new packaging will make sugary soft drinks more appealing to children cant decide which soft drink to buy help may be at hand with a new drinks bottle that has flavour buttons to give you multiple choices in one container the programmable bottle designed by a us company could also improve choices for shampoos sauces paints and perfumes while reducing manufacturing costs and taking up less shelf space its developers say the idea here is that the company can launch more variety but distribute less product around the country says tom woolf president and founder of ipifini based in sudbury massachusetts the concept came from software that woolf invented called innovation engine which pulls knowledge from databases to systematically help the user improve an existing product or come up with a new idea when it comes to improving soft drinks food manufacturers appeal to broad tastes for instance brand colas come in several flavours building and operating several factory lines to accommodate each flavour is more expensive than using just one distributing the variety of flavours is also a challenge each store needs more of one flavour than another which can make ordering and stocking an inventory nightmare and although large stores may be able to accommodate all flavours small stores usually have limited shelf space but the programmable bottle would require just one factory line to dispense the base flavour such as cola several different flavours would be locked in sealed plastic buttons around the edge of the bottle neck a customer could choose cherry cola for example by pressing the cherry button squirting the flavour into the drink to get cherry vanilla both cherry and vanilla flavour buttons could be pressed other products such as paint perfume and shampoos could also offer customised colours scents or conditioning formulas drink or toy but the bottle may have some unintentional consequences for children its clear to me that it will be seen as a toy says diane levin professor of education at wheelock college in boston and an expert in how popular culture affects child development any child looking at that bottle will want to play with the buttons she says pointing out that if the bottle is used for sugary soft drinks it has the potential for luring kids into seeing junk food as something to play with but woolf disagrees i dont think its going to change how many people drink sugared drinks or nonsugared drinks he says according to woolf the first use of the bottle will be for flavoured sugarless water ipifini has licenced the technology to a company that sells flavours worldwide sudoku tests your brains neural circuits especially ones involved in memory no wonder sudoku puzzles give your brain a good workout scientists say solving them depends on neural pathways that even the most powerful computers cant replicate they say that by studying how people solve the puzzles we might be able to develop more intelligent and brainlike computers in a paper published on the arxiv physics website professor john hopfield of princeton university explores the unique brain processes we use when playing sudoku this mathematical puzzle involves filling in a grid of squares with varying combinations of the numbers one to nine something that sounds simple but can be diabolically hard to crack sudoku our brains use a unique set of neural pathways known as associative memory hopfield says which enables us to discover a pattern from a partial clue although computers can store large amounts of information and process it at great speed they arent yet capable of sophisticated associative memory hopfield provides an algorithm of associative memory in his paper which he says could be implemented in silicon chips patterns we all recognise the basic pattern of counting from one to nine yet the task of completing a sudoku puzzle is confounded because of the large number of possible permutations of this pattern but every time we put the right number in the right place it provides us with a clue which reduces the number of permutations in this way sudoku is based on a combination of logic and intelligent guesswork based on our abilities of associative memory hopfield says in neural terms the signals developed can produce a strong and reasonably accurate feeling of correctness of the item retrieved hopfield says this fact may account for our strong psychological feeling of right or wrong when we retrieve a memory from a minimal clue brains versus computers associate professor andrew paplinski is an australian computer scientist who specialises in neural networks at monash university in melbourne he says the process described in hopfields paper helps us to remember a name from a fragment or recognise a partially obscured face he says applying hopfields model could lead to more accurate facial recognition computer technology being able to mimic associative memory would give computers extreme robustness of pattern recognition paplinski says for example for a computer to recognise a partially visible face it would first have to recognise that the face is obscured then that it is a face and then it would have to find a match to answer all these questions takes an enormous amount of computation he says he says we can do this in a fraction of a second in a slow computer like our brain so there were would be significant implications if we can figure out how this is done and design computers that can replicate it not breathing while training with weights can increase the pressure on your eyes potentially leading to glaucoma holding your breath while youre weight lifting can increase the risk of developing eye disease and potentially blindness a study says weight lifters who dont breathe while theyre training can experience temporary increases in eye pressure that could heighten the risk of developing glaucoma according to a study published in the archives of ophthalmology this week researchers at the catholic university of brasilia in brazil measured the intraocular pressure of men aged to during a bench press session we tested subjects performing a bench press a popular exercise in gyms the researchers say a bench press is done by lying on your back on a bench and raising a bar bell above your chest the researchers measured eye pressure while the subjects were holding their breath and compared this to when they were exhaling the study found that eye pressure increased more if they were holding their breath than if they were breathing according to the findings of subjects had an increase in eye pressure when they didnt exhale while doing the bench presses compared with who did the mean intraocular pressure increased significantly during weight lifting the researchers conclude prolonged weightlifting could be a potential risk factor for the development or progression of glaucoma musicians also at risk glaucoma is a condition associated with pressure on the eye the pressure slowly destroys the optic nerve at the back of the eye causing vision impairment and possible blindness the researchers say the form of glaucoma relevant to weight lifters is known as normaltension or lowtension glaucoma this is most common in people who experience frequent changes in eye pressure the disease can be hard to pick up because it develops even though eye pressure is normal when its measured in routine checks its also more common among people who play highresistance wind instruments or those with asthma or intestinal or urinary tract blockages intermittent intraocular pressure increases during weightlifting should be suspected in patients with normal tension glaucoma who perform such exercises the authors conclude computergenerated image of tres as seen from the night side with its host star in the distance astronomers using a tiny amateurclass telescope and offtheshelf camera lenses have found a jupitersized planet orbiting a star lightyears from earth the planet called tres is the first to be found in this particular field of view known as the kepler field the discovery is the second for a network called the transatlantic exoplanet survey or tres which taps small telescopes in california arizona and the canary islands to hunt for planets outside our solar system the team looks for planets that pass in front of their parent stars relative to the view from earth as the planets transit they slightly dim the total amount of visible light that radiates from the star as seen from earth by observing the star over a period of weeks or months astronomers can detect if there are any objects that temporarily and regularly block a bit of sunlight its really difficult to make these measurements says francis odonovan a graduate student at the california institute of technology and the lead author of a paper slated to appear in the astrophysical journal tres is a gas giant similar to jupiter but somewhat bigger and more massive but unlike jupiter tres is very close to its parent star and very hot the planet dims its parent stars light by only as it passes around every days the astronomers also had to rule out other possible explanations for the dimming such as a partner star gravitationally locked in orbit with the target star called gsc and located in the constellation draco finally after months of work the observation was confirmed by a large metre telescope at the keck observatory in hawaii all our hard work was made worthwhile when we saw the results odonovan says who hopes to parlay his discovery into a doctorate degree in astronomy odonovans goal is to find earthsized planets beyond our solar system but for that he will need much more powerful telescopes he may return to the tres discovery in the future the planet is the first found in the kepler field a part of the sky that will be the sole target of a nasa telescope slated for launch in the kepler space telescope is designed to find earthlike planets in orbits that favour the development of life the tres network involves the sleuth telescope at caltechs palomar observatory in san diego county the planet search survey telescope at lowell observatory near flagstaff arizona and the stellar astrophysics and research on exoplanets stare telescope in the canary islands a new larger telescope funded by the discovery channel is under development at lowell that will also be used for hunting extrasolar planets scientists have found whats thought to be the first link between storms on earth and turbulence in space thunderstorms on earth can lead to storms in the outer reaches of the atmosphere that disrupt radio transmissions and other electronic communications us researchers say the research which is published in a recent issue of the journal geophysical research letters is believed to be the first time researchers have found a global link between weather on earth and in space the discovery could lead to more reliable globalpositioning satellite gps navigation and shortwave radio transmissions by improving forecasts of highaltitude disturbances that can disrupt them says university of california berkeley researcher dr thomas immel using data from nasa satellites immel and other researchers discovered that thunderstorms over south america africa and southeast asia can create turbulence above the equator in part of the upper atmosphere known as the ionosphere the ionosphere is formed from solar xrays and ultraviolet light which break apart atoms and molecules in the upper atomosphere creating a layer of electrically charged gas known as plasma the densest part of the ionosphere forms two bands of plasma close to the equator at a hight of about kilometres these plasma bands are far too thin to be directly affected by wind from thunderstorms but the researchers found that the wind can shape the plasma bands by generating electricity in the layer of atmosphere below them three of the densest sections of plasma were located directly above areas with frequent thunderstorms the amazon basin in south america the congo basin in africa and indonesia but the researchers found another dense section of plasma above the pacific ocean far from thunderstorm zones they say this is evidence that tropical thunderstorms have a global influence that may explain why the ionosphere above north america is more turbulent than other areas disrupting radio transmissions that travel through it we now know that accurate predictions of ionospheric disturbances have to incorporate this effect from tropical weather immel says researchers now hope to determine if the plasma bands shift with the seasons or during large events like hurricanes the return of a fragment of the parthenon to greece shouldnt set a precedent for the repatriation of other museum pieces says the university of heidelberg the battle over fragments taken from greeces parthenon has resurfaced with the return of a small piece of the ancient monument by a german university the fragment consists of a foot carved from marble which was taken nearly years ago from the northern frieze greek officials hailed the fragments recent return as an important step toward the return of other fragments of the th century bc building many of which are kept at the british museum in london the relief sculpture which measures about by centimetres had been held at the university of heidelberg for more than years and first appeared in the universitys inventory in it was probably taken as a souvenir by a german visitor to greece this is a historic day for the first time in almost years a precious piece of the parthenon abroad is put in its original place greek culture minister giorgos voulgarakis said as the sculpture was handed over by the universitys vicerector professor angelos chaniotis the university of heidelberg says the decision to return the fragment was guided by the scholarly aim of promoting the unification of the parthenon as a unique monument of world culture voulgarakis hails the repatriation of the small fragment not only as a highly symbolic act but as an unprecedented move in favour of the reunification of greeces artistic heritage for the first time the silent agreement among museums in possession of parthenon sculptures has been broken he says archaeological artefacts scattered the fearless horsemen sprightly youths lounging deities belligerent centaurs and expressive horses carved by phidias in the th century bc are scattered throughout several european museums including the louvre in paris but the bulk of the marbles are kept in londons british museum greece contends that the figures and panels on display there were stolen in by lord elgin british ambassador to the ottoman empire the works have since become known as the elgin marbles britain says that lord elgin had permission from the ruling turkish authorities to take them the british also contend that the marbles have received better treatment at the british museum where they are safe from the polluted athens air which has damaged other greek treasures voulgarakis remarks that a space in the new acropolis museum which is due to be completed next year has been reserved for the parthenon sculptures the demand for unification of the parthenon sculptures originates exclusively by moral reasons and not by a nationalistic obsession he says a precedent the university of heidelberg stresses that the transfer of the fragment is a special case that should not be used as a precedent for other monuments and works of art but the german gesture is likely to cause controversy among museums worldwide in when negotiations were under way to return a parthenon fragment held at the salinas regional archaeological museum in palermo sicily directors of several major museums around the world deplored the move saying that it could destabilise the entire museum system pluto or is in the centre and its satellite charon is just below it the newly discovered satellites now called ii and iii are to the right pluto has been stripped of its membership of the cosmic alist and given a humble new tag the enigmatic icy world spotted in is know officially known as pluto it has been lumped among asteroids and other small bodies by the minor planet center part of the international astronomical union iau plutos satellites charon nix and hydra have been numbered i ii and iii respectively under the latest minor planet list the iau last month declared pluto to be a dwarf planet that should not belong among the hallowed ranks of mercury earth venus mars jupiter saturn uranus and neptune the organisation is now drawing up a catalogue of dwarf planets whose initial members will include pluto the large asteroid ceres and a distant object ub unofficially named xena until the iau meeting ub had laid claim to being the solar systems th planet rebel astronomers are circulating a petition contesting the dwarf planet definition as unscientific and the decision on pluto as undemocratic they intend to hold a conference next year that in their view will overhaul the definition of a planet plutos status had long been contested by astronomers who say its tiny size odd orbit and orbital plane preclude it from joining the other acknowledged planets by the new iau yardstick a planet has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit in other words it is massive enough to wield a gravity that clears rocks and other debris on its orbital path the report likens the rock art to the palaeolithic art of western europe the largest collection of ancient rock art in the world located in the rugged northwest of australia should be entirely protected from industry says a new report the report on the archaeology and rock art in the dampier archipelago was released this week by the national trust of australia wa it fuels ongoing debate about development in the area which is being considered for national heritage listing robin chapple of the national trust says there are around a million rock carvings on the archipelago and he says of these petroglyphs are estimated to be on the burrup peninsula where woodside energy was recently granted permission from the western australian government to begin development of a natural gas project its basically the largest collection of rock carvings in one location says chapple the report says some of the oldest of the carvings which are tens of thousands of years old include those of archaic faces and there are also depictions of animals that disappeared long before europeans arrived on the continent for example there are carvings of thylacines which have been extinct on the mainland for years other evidence of prehistoric human activity on the archipelago includes food preparation sites quarries stone arrangements and terraces its a bit like walking into the mary celeste says chapple youve got this whole feeling like youre actually in someones living room the last neanderthals holed up in gibraltar a refuge on the balmy southern tip of europe until their lineage withered away scientists say neanderthals lived in southern europe as recently as years ago had a varied diet and used sophisticated tools and weapons scientists say homo neanderthalensis was thought to have survived in europe until the arrival of modern humans about years ago but new findings by professor clive finlayson of the gibraltar museum show the two groups may have coexisted in europe for years or longer we are showing quite clearly that they survived at the very least until years ago and possibly as recently as years that is significantly later than previously thought finlayson says with europe in the grip of an ice age and with their smarter cousins homo sapiens spreading across the continent the last neanderthals holed up in a refuge on the balmy southern tip of europe until their lineage withered away the study says neanderthals were predecessors of modern humans who inhabited europe and parts of west and central asia despite their image as clubcarrying hairy brutes research suggests they were expert tool makers used animal skins to keep warm and may have cared for each other during a new excavation at gorhams cave a rich source of prehistoric artefacts in gibraltar finlayson found a campfire made by neanderthals and remains of tools flint weapons and animal fossils remains included those of mammals birds and shellfish finlayson says charcoal found at the site enabled the scientists to date it they were also able to reconstruct the environment in which the late neanderthals lived and found it included a variety of plants it indicates to us that in spite of the glaciations further up in europe this was a place where the climate was still sufficiently mild for populations of neanderthals to survive quite late adds finlayson whose findings are reported online by the journal nature the last neanderthals that occupied gorhams cave had access to a diverse community of plants and vertebrates on the sandy plains open woodland and shrubland wetlands cliff and coastal environments surrounding the site the study says such ecological diversity might have facilitated their long survival the scientists are excavating further in the cave where stone tools were discovered more than years ago they will also be looking for neanderthal burial sites in the caves deeper parts coexisting with humans how long neanderthals and modern humans coexisted in the same geographical area is a subject of much debate with some researchers suggesting it could have been as short as years here we are looking at years if not more and that is a long time says finlayson it sounds like very little but if you transpose it into human generations today years is from the time of christ to the present and back he adds what happened to neanderthals then as to the great whodunnit of palaeontology the paper discounts the theory that these neanderthals were annihilated by h sapiens in the competition for food and territory evidence of stoneage technology at malaga about kilometres east of gibraltar shows that anatomically modern man had ventured into the neighbourhood at the time when the neanderthals lived in gorham cave this suggests that for several thousand years the region was a mosaic of remnant neanderthals and pioneering h sapiens living in thinlyscattered communities neanderthal dna in modern humans another theory to explain the disappearance of the neanderthals is that they did not disappear not genetically at any rate under this hypothesis neanderthals and h sapiens comingled far from being a dead branch of the human tree the neanderthals may even have bequeathed some of the traits in the h sapiens genome that we see today the new paper does not address this controversial theory but notes there is no evidence of transitional tools or activities at the cave this adds weight to the argument that the last neanderthals had only limited contact with h sapiens so interbreeding was unlikely the first evidence for the neanderthals emerged in when workers at a lime quarry in the neander valley western germany came across bones initially thought to be that of a bear since then the remains of about neanderthals have been found at sites ranging from southern england to continental europe and the middle east these magnetic patches cause variations in the suns brightness but research released today says these variations are not enough to cause climate change the suns energy output has barely varied over the past years according to a study that weakens claims that climate change is due to natural sunspot cycles an international team of researchers found that the suns brightness varies by only over year sunspot cycles far too little to account for the rise in temperatures since the industrial revolution our results imply that over the past century climate change due to human influences must far outweigh the effects of changes in the suns brightness says australian born dr tom wigley of the us national center for atmospheric research many scientists say that emissions of greenhouse gases mainly from burning fossil fuels in power plants factories and cars are the main cause of a degc rise in temperatures over the past century a smaller group of scientists says that the dominant cause of warming is a natural variation in the climate system or a gradual rise in the suns energy output the solar contribution to warming over the past years is negligible the researchers write in the journal nature based on evidence from satellite observations since they also found little sign of solar warming or cooling when they checked telescope observations of sunspots against temperature records going back to the th century they then checked more ancient evidence of rare isotopes and temperatures trapped in sea sediments and greenland and antarctic ice and also found no dramatic shifts in solar energy output for at least the past millennium sun not guilty says study this basically rules out the sun as the cause of global warming says dr henk spruit a coauthor of the report from the max planck institute for astrophysics in germany spruit says a little ice age around the th century when londons thames river froze seemed limited mainly to western europe and so was not a planetwide cooling that might have implied a dimmer sun and global ice ages like the last one that ended about years ago seem linked to cyclical shifts in the earths orbit around the sun rather than to changes in solar output overall we can find no evidence for solar luminosity variations of sufficient amplitude to drive significant climate variations on centennial millennial or even millionyear time scales the report says solar activity is now around a low on the year cycle after a peak when bright spots called faculae emit more heat and outweigh the heatplugging effect of dark sunspots both faculae and dark sunspots are most common at the peaks still the report also says there could be other more subtle solar effects on the climate such as from cosmic rays or ultraviolet radiation it says they would be hard to detect the doublepulsar system put einsteins theory of general relativity through its paces with whats believed to be the most stringent test yet pulses of radiation emitted from a pair of distant stars have confirmed that einsteins theory of general relativity is at least right scientists say an international research team including scientists working at australias parkes telescope measured the radiation from a double pulsar system lightyears away to put the theory through its paces according to results published online today in the journal science the yearold theory came through with top marks general relativity has passed all our tests says coauthor dr george hobbs from the australia telescope national facility the double pulsar system called psr ja and b consists of two highly compact neutron stars each of which weighs more than our own sun but measures only about kilometres across the two stars whirl around each other at a million kilometres an hour emitting lighthouselike beams of radio waves researchers used three of the worlds largest radio telescopes the uks lovell telescope at jodrell bank the parkes radio telescope and the robert c byrd green bank telescope in west virginia in the us to observe those beams over a period of three years their measurements offered a number of ways to test the accuracy of the theory of general relativity the most precise is called the shapiro delay and concerns einsteins prediction that massive objects warp spacetime einstein says that the whole concept of space and time are connected and that gravitational fields warp both of them explains hobbs this means that when one pulsar passes behind the other its signal travels through the warped spacetime created by the one in the foreground using einsteins theory the researchers calculated that this warping would add a microsecond delay to the arrival of the signal on earth which is just what their measurements found the first thing to say is that the prediction and the measurement agree hobbs says but it isnt possible for our measurement to be precise what the scientists can say for certain is that einsteins theory is accurate to at least within general relativity is used in astronomy all the time on the assumption that it is correct says hobbs this is the most stringent test ever made of it in the presence of a very strong gravitational field nanotechnology involves manipulating matter at the atomic or molecular level a ninepoint plan for the responsible development of nanotechnology in australia has been recommended in a new report but environmental and worker safety groups are still not happy the industry minister ian macfarlane this week released the report which he will consider when establishing a national nanotechnology strategy it recommends the establishment of a dedicated office within a federal department that will be responsible for the nanotechnology strategy although it does not recommend which portfolio this should fall under the report states that there is no case for establishing new nanotechnologyspecific regulations to protect human health and the environment but suggests existing regulations may need adjusting the options for a national nanotechnology strategy report also recommends further research into the health safety and environmental implications of nanotechnology and it recommends that any proposed changes to regulatory frameworks should not add unnecessary regulatory burden to industry nanoparticle risk australian council of trade unions occupational health and safety officer steve mullins supports the establishment of a specific office to oversee nanotechnology but he criticises the reports failure to recommend the establishment of new regulations specific to nanotechnology it seems like business has the green light to use nanotechnology but theyve got a red light on health and safety regulation he says the unions are particularly concerned about the exposure of workers to nanoparticles and believe precautionary measures should be taken to ensure this is minimised by all means continue research says mullins but weve got enough evidence to suggest nanoparticles can have a toxic effect on the body georgia miller of the friends of the earths nanotechnology project also criticises the report she says it fails to require safety testing of nanoparticles before they are commercialised as recommended by the uks royal society in she says there should be a moratorium on rd and manufacture on nanotechnology until safety issues are resolved the celestial body now known as eris with her moon dysnomia xena the lonely rock at the edge of the solar system that caused plutos downfall has now been officially named eris after the greek goddess of strife eris caused strife and discord by causing quarrels among people and thats what this one has done too says assistant professor mike brown the california institute of technology researcher who discovered the object browns discovery larger and further from the sun than pluto set off a heated debate about what should be considered a planet the members of the international astronomical union decided last month to downgrade pluto to a dwarf planet leaving only eight full planets in the solar system many scientists have not accepted the change eris pronounced eeris is also considered a dwarf planet the most distant known solar system object from the sun it takes years to complete an orbit unlike pluto its orbit does not cross paths with neptune the most distant fullsized planet the body was dubbed ub after it was discovered brown nicknamed it xena after the television warrior princess but he says he didnt consider that to be an appropriate formal name for a celestial body then the next one would be spock or something and that wouldnt be quite so dignified brown says the astronomers union accepted eris this week the group also accepted browns proposed name for eriss moon dysnomia dysnomia is eriss daughter in greek mythology and the word means lawlessness in greek it sounds like a disease but in any case we all liked it says dr ted bowell an astronomer at lowell observatory in arizona who heads the division of the astronomers union that deals with planets brown says he plans to study eris and dysnomia further to figure out the dwarf planets mass and density greek mythology in greek mythology eris started the trojan war after she was excluded from a wedding on mount olympus home of the gods to get revenge she tossed an apple inscribed to the most beautiful one into the party causing a squabble among the goddesses paris the prince of troy was forced to settle the dispute by picking one goddess as most beautiful earning the spite of the others and the ultimate defeat of his city in the trojan war chlamydia infects the back of the crocodiles throats causing an inflammation that blocks the airway chlamydia is suffocating thousands of young farmed crocodiles in australias north say experts dr ian jerrett senior veterinary pathologist at the northern territory governments berrimah veterinary laboratories says the disease is killing saltwater crocodiles crocodilus porosus i think its the first very serious disease of crocodiles that weve recognised since farming started jerrett says the disease affects young crocodiles between three and five months old causing an eye discharge and severe inflammation at the back of the throat that stops them from breathing these crocodiles are dying from obstruction of the larynx says jerrett they cant breathe because of the amount of damage in the back of the throat the disease has been found so far on four of the five large crocodile farms in the northern territory says jerrett with two farms seriously affected one farm over a period of two months lost about of their young crocodiles which was nearly the whole crop for that year he says and another farm lost over which was about of their crop for the year at first a pox virus was suspected but virtually all the samples taken from the animals have since shown the culprit is chlamydia unusual bacteria that need host cells to multiply the researchers will use dna analysis to compare the strain to those that infect other animals such as wild birds but they suspect it will be a strain specific to crocodiles the strain involved is related to the strains that infect columnar epithelial cells in the genitals and eyes of koalas and humans says jerrett mosquitoes carrying the malarial parasite are responsible for killing about a million people a year ddt the longbanned insecticide blamed for killing birds and other wildlife is now approved for use indoors to fight malaria says the world health organization one of the best tools we have against malaria is indoor residual house spraying says dr arata kochi director of the who malaria department of the dozen pesticides who has approved as safe for house spraying the most effective is ddt for about us per house indoor spraying with ddt is a costeffective response to malaria says the who malaria kills about a million people annually most of them children under five in parts of africa and asia where malariacarrying mosquitoes spread the disease of home dwellers approached by health workers allow their houses to be sprayed say global health officials ddt came into common use in the s as an agricultural insecticide it became notorious after biologist and ecologist rachel carsons book silent spring exposed how ddt entered the food chain killing wildlife and threatening humans in the us national cancer institute announced findings that ddt could cause cancer and a us federal ban was imposed in richard tren director of the group africa fighting malaria stresses the difference between agricultural ddt sprayed outdoors and the residual spraying means to act like a giant mosquito net over individual houses the environmental impact associated with spraying insecticides whether its ddt or other insecticides indoors is minimal its negligible this is as unrelated to silent spring as anything tren says the science is very clear that there are no harmful human effects tren says environmental groups in africa support its use in washington the director of the sierra clubs environmental quality program gives muted backing to the plan reluctantly we do support it says the groups ed hopkins malaria kills millions of people and when there are no other alternatives to indoor use of ddt and where that use will be wellmonitored and controlled we support it hopkins stresses the need for safer alternatives to ddt because ddt is not a silver bullet to solve this problem damaged telomeres have prevented this yeast cell from dividing instead it has continuously replicated its dna to prepare for division this has resulted in numerous copies of dna seen here as multiple bright spots an australianborn scientist is among three researchers who have been awarded a prestigious lasker award for the discovery of telomerase an enzyme key to ageing and cancer professor elizabeth blackburn of the university of california san francisco has been awarded the lasker award for basic medical research she shares the award with professor carol greider of johns hopkins university school of medicine in baltimore and professor jack szostak of harvard medical school and the howard hughes medical institute the three predicted and discovered telomerase an enzyme that synthesises and protects the telomeres at the ends of chromosomes their discoveries laid the groundwork for studies connecting telomerase and telomeres to human cancer and agerelated conditions today telomerase research is one of the hottest fields of biomedical science says dr joseph goldstein who won a lasker and a nobel prize for helping to discover cholesterol and who chairs the lasker jury blackburn a stem cell scientist was dismissed from the us presidents council on bioethics in amid controversy over her support of embryonic stem cell research which president george w bush opposes the awards considered the us equivalents of the nobel prizes for medical research carry an award of us the lasker award for clinical medical research went to aaron beck emeritus professor of the university of pennsylvania school of medicine for developing cognitive therapy cognitive therapy a type of talk therapy can treat mental conditions such as depression suicidal behaviour and eating disorders the lasker award for special achievement in medical science went to joseph gall of the carnegie institutions department of embryology at baltimore for his work as a founder of modern cell biology and an early champion of women in science gall invented a technique called in situ hybridisation now routinely used by scientists this method can pinpoint a single gene among the present in the genomes of humans and animals goldstein says the lasker awards first presented in are administered by the lasker foundation the ability to download music has made it possible for athletes to better exploit the power of music while training and competing technology like the mp player is revolutionising sports psychology according to an expert who says these devices are allowing athletes to harness the psychological benefits of music as never before professor peter terry of the university of southern queensland says technology like running shoes that increase the beat of music in time with a runners pace and even implantable micromp players may one day give athletes the winning edge its certainly going to add a new level to athletic potential says terry who has been to seven olympic games as a sports psychologist and published widely on the power of music in enhancing athletic performance but he says the technology could create a whole new conundrum for sports authorities by making them redefine whether the use of performance enhancing music is cheating terry will talk about the latest research into the psychological effects of music in sport at a joint conference of the australian psychological society and the new zealand psychological society in auckland next week terry says the benefits of music on exercise have been known since the days that galley slaves were forced to row to the rhythm of drum beats but its only in the past decade that this has been scientifically demonstrated music boosts performance in a number of ways he says if you synchronise whatever activity youre engaging in to the tempo of music theres a very clearly energic effect he says in other words if you play music with a fast tempo people work harder music also acts as a mood enhancer which can put athletes in a winning mood he says music like eye of the tiger and the theme from rocky are classics whitney houstons one moment in time was a particular favourite with certain members of the australian team during the sydney olympics who saw it as reflecting their personal goal to seize their moment its a bit cheesy but a number of people really bought into it and the lyrics supported what they were about he says but music choices can sometimes be counterintuitive he says citing a super heavyweight boxer who liked to listen to classical japanese music before getting into the ring terry says a computer company has already entered a deal with a sportswear manufacturer to produce an armband you can slip your mp player into also in the pipeline are shoes with sensors that pick up how fast youre going and coordinate the beat of the music to ensure you maintain the pace he also says being able to download music has made it easier for athletes to come up with music thats highly personalised to their individual training and competing program in haile gebreselasie set an indoor world record for the metres by synchronising his stride rate to the song scatman at the moment the attitude towards that is that its almost cheating and thats because that synchronous effect is so well understood terry says the question of cheating may become even more fraught with the prospect of tiny mp players that can be worn under the skin people are already having implants for contraception why not for performance terry says i think theres a whole new world possible as microtechnology develops australian diggers in the trenches of gallipoli in australia is to be part of a major threenation archaeological survey of the gallipoli battlefield researchers say associate professor chris mackie from the university of melbourne says the survey will combine conventional mapping with electromagnetic surveying to produce the most comprehensive historical and archaeological study ever conducted there most of the attention in the postwar period has been on the cemeteries he says about studies of turkeys gallipoli peninsula one of the things well be spending a great deal of time on is the mapping of the trenches to see how they cohere with surviving maps of the trenches and exploring what lies beneath mackie says theres a distinct possibility that a wealth of material dating back to the days of antiquity lies buried beneath the battlefield perhaps the most historically significant military site in australias history records from sappers dating back to mention ancient pots ancient remains and so forth so there could be material there he says because well be using electromagnetics youre coming up with all sorts of possibilities everything from material left behind in the battle itself to much older stuff the survey which will be conducted by researchers from australia new zealand and turkey will also aim to identify any significant trenches command posts outposts and key battle areas says a spokesperson for the federal department of veterans affairs basically we hope to produce a catalogue of the ones we know of and also see if theres any ones we werent aware of the spokesperson says the researchers hope to get together a comprehensive record of sites gauge their condition and also recommend any ways that we can possibly protect them and enhance them will the site be dug up mackie says because of the historical and cultural sensitivity of the site theres no intention to embark on any excavation the veterans affairs spokesperson says its going to be fairly comprehensive archaeological historical research mackie says many people are unaware of the historical importance of the region which includes the nearby site of the ancient battle of troy the project was scheduled to have started earlier this year but has been delayed by diplomatic and heritage considerations the veterans affairs spokesperson says remains of diggers found in belgium confirmation of the gallipoli survey comes as the federal government announces that the remains of what are believed to be five australian world war i soldiers have been found on the western front in belgium during excavations for a gas line at frenzenbergstraat in zonnebeke the discovery has been reported to the commonwealth war graves commission and the office of australian war graves is awaiting a full report says veterans affairs minister bruce billson he says the government will attempt to identify the remains once a report is at hand the solarb mission will measure the movement of magnetic fields and how the suns atmosphere responds to them scientists will launch a new space mission later this week to study the most violent explosions in the solar system by monitoring the suns magnetic field the solarb mission a uk us and japanese collaboration hopes to learn more about solar flares these bursts of energy are equivalent to tens of millions of hydrogen bombs exploding in a matter of minutes the scientists say what we want to do is explore the most energetic explosions in the solar system so we can actually predict when they will occur and why they happen professor louise harra of university college londons mullard space science laboratory told a recent conference instruments on the spacecraft will measure the movement of magnetic fields and how the suns atmosphere responds to them the mission will focus on solar flares trigger phase solar flares occur when energy stored in twisted magnetic fields is suddenly released and the largest flares occur where there are the strongest magnetic fields flares are usually associated with sunspots dark cool areas caused by intense magnetic fields breaking through the suns surface they pose a danger to astronauts and spacecraft and can cause havoc with satellite links power grids and mobile phone networks on earth solar flares are fast and furious they can cause communication blackouts on earth within minutes of a flare erupting on the suns surface says harra in terms of heat it is times hotter than a volcanic eruption she added in a briefing at the recent british association for the advancement of science festival the heat generated by a solar flare first observed in england in causes atmospheric gases to start to move at enormous speeds more than times faster than the speed of concorde solarb is set to launch on saturday morning australia time late friday utc from the uchinoura space centre in southern japan during its threeyear mission it will orbit at an altitude of kilometres to get a continuous view of the sun harra says a better understanding of solar flares could provide information about how magnetic fields release huge amounts of energy and whether life can exist somewhere else the king protea one of the largest of all south african proteas is related to proteas throughout the southern hemisphere the protea family spread through the southern hemisphere by riding on fragments of the ancient supercontinent gondwana according to a scientist who says his research deals a blow to intelligent design australias dr peter weston the principle research scientist at the national herbarium of new south wales has been researching the biogeography of the family proteaceae the family is common in australia and includes waratahs grevilleas proteas banksias and even macadamia trees varieties are also found in south africa southeast asia new guinea new caledonia new zealand and madagascar most of the areas in which they grow are pieces of gondwana that started fragmenting hundreds of millions of years ago weston says after the idea of continental drift became accepted in the late s and early s it also became accepted that the proteaceae became primarily distributed as a result of continental drift weston is looking at how species spread to different parts of the world and evolveed and is using molecular dating to support this hypothesis he will discuss his latest research in an australian academy of science lecture in canberra next month for example he says his analysis shows that the ancestors of the sydney waratah come from northern queensland new guinea and as far as peru ecuador chile and argentina the research supports darwins theory of evolution as opposed to the view that everything was simultaneously created by an intelligent designer weston says life on earth has evolved together so weve got a narrative of the history of the earth and weve got a comparable story about the history of these plants he says if these plants hadnt evolved why would you expect this degree of agreement but molecular dating by weston and colleagues at rhodes university in south africa has come up with some surprises when compared with geological data on continental drift for example some groups of protea found both in australia and africa have been dated at about million years old millions of years after gondwana split this makes them too young to have arrived by continental drift because according to geological records the last time africa was connected to the rest of gondwana was more than million years ago so how did they arrive in australia weston says some protea seeds are light and aerodynamic making it likely they were distributed on the wind the strange case of the macadamia tree but more puzzling is the strange case of the macadamia molecular dating shows the variety found in africas western cape split from the australian variety about million years or million years after the accepted time of continental fragmentation because macadamia nuts are heavy and rocklike its unlikely they were carried by the wind or even floated across the ocean weston says the split also predates humans ruling out that they were distributed by hand i find it hard to explain he admits weston says while darwin believed biogeography was a crucial test of evolution the great naturalist didnt support continental instability but his friend the british botanist joseph hooker suggested as early as that proteaceae in southern continents must have achieved their distribution through climatic and geographic conditions genes influence how you learn to read and spell the genes involved in learning to sound out words are different from the ones involved in learning to recognise words by sight according to an australian study the finding published online in the journal reading and writing adds fuel to the debate about the best way of teaching children to read there are two particular skills that children need to learn if they are going to be good readers the first is the sounding out process known as phonics the other skill is being able to recognise familiar words pretty much by sight this helps when they read words such as yacht that dont follow the phonics rule researchers including associate professor anne castles from the university of melbourne tested different genetic models for reading and spelling in sets of identical and nonidentical twins to determine to what extent these skills are genetically based twins are ideal for this type of research because identical twins are more similar genetically than nonidentical twins so if a skill has a genetic basis identical twins tend to be more similar to each other than nonidentical twins the researchers found that both reading and spelling skills do have a genetic basis although a childs environment is also important not all of that skill is something you are born with but there is a genetic component castles says the particularly novel thing about this study is that different sets of genes seem to be involved to some degree for those different processes so the genes for learning to sound words out are different from the ones that are involved in learning to recognise words by sight but certainly many genes were shared in common as well a second finding is that reading and spelling have a common genetic basis meaning that if children are having difficulty spelling they will also be likely to struggle with learning to read castles says the research has implications for future research into reading and spelling the existence of different reading subskills with different genetic bases needs to be reflected in our theories of reading and its acquisition she says the next time you go to a sports game at a large openair stadium listen to the weather forecast say meteorologists large openair stadiums could be severe weather death traps says a us meteorologist in a new study on lightning storms and sports stadiums few people have been struck by lightning in stadiums and no us stadium has suffered a direct tornado hit during a game but the university of colorado scientist says stadiums are not immune to these dangers and stadium managers can do something to prevent a calamity the most infamous case of a poorly handled lightning storm at a big stadium was the virginia tech game at rkf stadium in washington dc reports joel gratz in the september issue of the bulletin of the american meteorological society lightning struck and killed one woman and caused numerous injuries when people panicked and raced chaotically to escape the stadium through narrow tunnels the stadiums jammed tunnels left many people in the open without protection during the next minutes there were more lightning strikes within a mile of the stadium says gratz what went wrong stadium managers had no plan police and ushers were unprepared to help people find cover the stadium speaker system was inadequate and there was no lightning evacuation plan says gratz ironically the reason there are no lightning plans is simple the odds are miniscule that lightning will strike in a stadium just when a game is under way gratz says statistically it may not make a lot of sense to look into it says gratz but then again he points out odds are also very low of a terrorist attacks at any given stadium yet there are plans in place for that lightning is also one of those lowrisk but highimpact events you cant just activate your terrorist plan when a lightning storm approaches and expect it to help gratz explains unlike a terrorist threat moving people into the carpark or open field during an electrical storm will probably hurt people he says whats needed are evacuation plans that use the most lightningprotected places inside a stadium nearby buildings as well as better monitoring of the approaching weather by stadium officials he says spectators themselves can prevent trouble too by paying better attention to severe weather warnings and acting on them says meteorologist professor william gallus of iowa state university gallus got a firsthand look at how tricky severe weather warnings and stadiums can be when a tornado threatened the jack trice stadium in ames iowa last november when this tornado touched down it was miles kilometres away it was live on tv says gallus tailgaters in the stadium carpark were watching it on portable televisions he says yet there was little comprehension among spectators or stadium officials that at kilometres per hour the tornado could potentially reach the stadium in just minutes this event could have been such a tragedy says gallus fortunately the tornado did not hit the stadium this time people need to realise they need to take personal responsibility for their safety he says there is indeed a certain tendency for spectators to put on blinkers gratz says when you go into a stadium as a spectator people have weather information on pdas and cell phones but no one is really going to notice with the bright lights and game that there is an electrical storm miles away gratz admits he has fallen prey to this blindness he was at a game at denvers invesco stadium when his father called his mobile phone and asked him why if he was such a knowledgeable weather person was he sitting out in the open at a stadium along with other people when a nasty electrical storm was closing in it was fatherly wisdom recalls gratz and its exactly what got him interested in whether stadium management was really prepared the fossil child has been named selam which means peace in ethiopias official amharic language a millionyearold skeleton of the earliest child ever found shows the ancient ancestor of modern humans walked upright but may also have climbed trees scientists say they found the wellpreserved remains of a threeyearold girl of the species australopithecus afarensis which includes the fossil skeleton known as lucy in the dikika area of ethiopia it represents the earliest and most complete partial skeleton of a child ever found in the history of palaeoanthropology says dr zeresenay alemseged of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig germany the skull torso and upper and lower limbs including the hand show both human and apelike features the scientists report in the latest issue of the journal nature the state of the ancient bones found kilometres northeast of the capital addis ababa suggest she was buried in a flood which may also have caused her death the remains provide the first evidence of what babies of early human ancestors looked like the nearly complete skeleton will also provide information about the childs height and structure this child will help us understand a lot about the species to which it belongs says alemseged leader of the international team of scientists the lower part of the body which includes the foot the shin bone and the thigh bone clearly shows us that this species was an upright walking creature he says but some of the features from the upper part of the body including the shoulder blade and arms are more apelike the fingers are long and curved which suggest she might have been able to swing through trees the finding is the most complete hominid skeleton ever found in the world says alemseged he says the fossil was older than the millionyearold remains of lucy discovered in described by scientists as one of the worlds greatest archaeological finds the new bones belong to a threeyearold girl who lived million years ago years before lucy alemseged says the fossil has been named selam which means peace in ethiopias official amharic language dr simon underdown of oxford brookes university in england describes it as a massively exciting discovery of a juvenile lucy this tremendous fossil will make us challenge many of the ideas we have about how and why we came to walk on two feet he says an analysis of the sediment in which the remains were found enabled researchers to build a picture of the type of environment in which the child lived it was a lush area with flowing water forests and grassland which was also affected by volcanic eruptions the range of habitats was suitable for hippos crocodiles and relatives of the wildebeest we can see from the sediment that the region was very much characterised by a mosaic of environment that ranged from forests and woodlands near the rivers to seasonally flooded grasslands to a flood plain that would have supported more open vegetation says dr jonathan wynn of the university of south florida who dated the sediments surrounding the remains australopithecus once thought by some to be our ancestor a afarensis is now widely considered to be a failed branch of the human tree for many experts suspect the hominid was anatomically far closer to apes than humans its brain adjusted to its body size was not much larger than that of a chimpanzee and although it no longer had the large canines that distinguished apes from hominids it had relatively large chewing teeth that were still primitive the other comparably complete infant hominid skeleton in the fossil record is that of a neanderthal child who lived less than years ago could you be churning out your own car from a desktop factory in years within years desktop nanofactories could pump out anything from a new car to a novel nanoweapon says a technology commentator and he warns that society needs to start preparing for this brave new world mike treder from the center for responsible nanotechnology crn in new york says advanced nanotechnology like these nanofactories could help solve world poverty but it could also wreak economic and social chaos its the biggest challenge weve ever faced as a species says treder who has been addressing scientists in australia this week crn is a nonprofit organisation advised among others by the socalled father of nanotechnology dr eric drexler the organisation says it aims to raise awareness about the benefits and dangers of molecular manufacturing the precise assembly of products atombyatom while molecular manufacturing is not yet a reality treder says researchers are already working on building molecularscale machines that could eventually move atoms around to make products and he says that in less than years nanoscale factories could be making consumer products from cups and chairs to cars and house bricks raw materials like carbon would be pumped into the nanofactory where atoms would be rearranged to make products according to programs downloaded from the internet says treder warnings treder says such desktop nanofactories could help reduce poverty and starvation in developing nations and provide tremendous medical benefits but society needs to guard against its potential risks in particular he says crn is concerned that these desktop nanofactories would lead to a nano arms race in which hardtodetect nanoweapons could be designed manufactured and tested much quicker than they are today imagine a suitcase filled with billions of toxincarrying flying robots that could be released anywhere to target a population he says you could make a suitcase full of these things overnight for a few dollars the mass production of consumer goods by private desktop factories could also trigger social chaos due to economic disruption says treder if i can make my own car at home for a couple of hundred dollars with a design downloaded from the internet that means im not a customer of the auto dealer down the road waste from such easy manufacturing or nanolitter is another issue that needs to be thought about he says as is the prospect of nanospam flying foxes reportedly flew away from the storm probably in response to rapidly dropping air pressure cyclone larry which hit australias northeast in march has scattered flying foxes far and wide says a zoologist and csiros dr louise shilton needs to find this local species of crowsized fruiteating bat quickly the event is both good and bad for her ongoing project to monitor the usually poorly distributed animals its bad news because its rather difficult to study animals you cant find we need to be providing the best possible population data and we cant monitor them without knowing where they roost says shilton among her questions are what they are eating and where they have chosen to roost the good news is that when she finds them shell probably be able to learn what these animals regard as good habitat a matter of debate at the moment she says do they really depend solely on undisturbed forest or do they like urban areas where fruit trees are irrigated and predators are few its the sort of thing people who love and those who loathe flying foxes want to know theres this kind of lovehate relationship with fruit bats in australia says shilton some people adore them and point to evidence that flying foxes play a critical role in pollinating and spreading the seeds of native plants others are less enthusiastic they do come into contact with fruit growers says shilton but they also come into conflict with people in urban environments thats because the bats congregate in large noisy crowds and produce foulsmelling guano the animosity was bad enough that it was once common for people to shoot flying foxes now however the local northern queensland species is protected and a permit is required to kill them this particular species is the one with the smallest distribution and it is believed to have the smallest population shilton says scattered or killed shilton is pretty certain the bats were scattered rather than killed by the cyclone because she visited known roosting sites and found few dead animals just a handful compared to the that had been around before the storm and some people reported seeing the bats hurrying away en masse before the storm arrived probably a natural response to quickly dropping air pressure i would agree that queensland probably does offer more places for the flying foxes to escape the storm says dr kim mcconkey a wildlife researcher who studied the effects of another cyclone on another species of flying foxes in tonga we recorded an decline in flying fox abundance in tonga after the cyclone and this was almost certainly due to mortality either directly during the storm or afterwards due to a lack of food and human hunting she adds mcconkeys colleagues also reported seeing bat carcasses in the lagoon after the island cyclone she says out in daylight to find out where the queensland bats are shilton has asked the public to call her with information already she says there are sightings of flying foxes heading out for food in daylight an unusual behaviour for the nocturnal animal that information alone suggests some bats are finding food scarce and working harder to get a meal meanwhile says shilton anyone cheering at the flying foxes disappearance shouldnt assume they have disappeared for good ive personally got no doubt that once the native trees come into season the bats will come back shilton says driveways roads and patios make up of impermeable urban surfaces so why not harvest that water rather than let it run away carparks patios and other paved areas could one day collect rainwater purify it then channel it to underground tanks for reuse say researchers special porous pavers made of concrete containing specific additives would purify the polluted runoff says professor simon beecham a civil engineer from the university of south australia the water could then be captured in large underground tanks and be used for irrigation cleaning and flushing the toilet he says were trying to harvest a resource that weve not been able to tap into before says beecham roads driveways pathways and the like make up of impervious urban surfaces and runoff from them causes flooding and pollutes our waterways until now harvesting rainwater from them has proved more difficult than from roofs says beecham his team is developing a system in which porous concrete pavers allows runoff to seep into underground tanks made of galvanised metal or a flexible plastic lining filled with gravel a special bonding material ensures the porous pavers are strong enough to withstand the heavy weight of cars and trucks and additives mixed into the pavers or into the sand and gravel bedding material beneath them enables the system to trap pollutants a paver injected with ferrous hydroxide for example traps toxic and persistent heavy metals like lead zinc and cadmium that come from sources such as car tyres brakelinings and exhaust a layer of microbes on fabric beneath the pavers can trap and degrade hydrocarbons such as oil and a layer of granulated activated carbon traps dissolved organic matter from leaf litter that is responsible for algal blooms in rivers says beecham he says the pollutants can accumulate in the pavers over to years allowing usable water to be caught and pumped above ground for reuse he says the pavers could also allow trees which themselves soak up and recycle water to grow more freely because their roots have access to more water and air problem tree roots could be avoided by using a special concrete device that directs the roots away from the pavers he says and the pavers could be seeded with low maintenance native vegetation including sedges beecham says one of his phd students baden myers is about to construct a fullscale prototype of the complete water harvesting and reuse system which he predicts will cost to more than conventional paving part of the research has been submitted to water management a journal of the uks institution of civil engineers the south australian government water authority sa water is a major source of finance for the research people who prefer old technology to new may form a new cultural group just as they have done in history an underclass of internet refuseniks may be breeding and planning terrorist acts in coming years to protest against technology according to a survey the poll by the pew internet and american life project an independent think tank asked people what they thought of the effect of the internet on social political and economic life in the year a total of technology thinkers and stakeholders took part in the online survey and a majority agreed with predictions that refuseniks will emerge as a cultural group characterised by their choice to live off the network and that some will resort to terror acts in protest against technology a total of of respondents disagreed with that scenario and had no opinion constant change will spook some into trying to slow everyone down through horrific and catastrophic terrorist attacks against the information infrastructure and all who rely upon it says sean mead of interbrand analytics who took part in the survey another respondent ed lyell an expert on the internet and education says todays ecoterrorists are the harbingers of this likely trend every age has a small percentage that cling to an overrated past of low technology low energy lifestyle he writes led by people who only know the idealised past not the reality of often painful past life styles these luddites will use violence to seek to stop even very positive progress but some respondents warn against quickly applying labels to those who question the advance of technology we need some strong dissenting voices about the impact of this technology in our lives writes denzil meyers of widgetwonder so far its been mostly the promise of a cureall just like the past industrial revolution the survey which was conducted with north carolinas elon university also found that a majority of internet leaders activists and analysts questioned agree with predictions that by a global lowcost network will be thriving and mobile communications will be available to anyone anywhere at low cost english will be a universal language of global communication but other languages such as mandarin could grow in prominence virtual reality on the internet will lead to more productivity but will also spawn new addiction problems humans will remain in charge of technology even as more activity is automated and smart agents proliferate and people will wittingly or unwittingly disclose more about themselves gaining some benefits in the process even as they lose some privacy many of these respondents knew from history and personal experience that technologies can have good and bad effects says lee rainie director of the pew project i come away with a sense that the future is still up for grabs even as everyone agrees that it will be very different from today new research suggests that a fall in methane emissions partly attributed to diminishing wetlands was only temporary chinas booming economy and the wetlands of the northern hemisphere have emerged as key factors in what could be a future escalation in emissions of the greenhouse gas methane according to new research a study of methane emissions published in the journal nature today reports that atmospheric methane has increased over the past seven years after dropping during the s the paper says chinas growing economy including its flourishing coal industry may be behind an increase in methane emissions from human activity but this has been offset by a drop in natural emissions from swamps bogs and wetlands which are drying out as a result of prolonged drought if the drying trend is reversed and emissions from wetlands return to normal atmospheric methane levels may increase again worsening the problem of climate change says one of the reports authors australian researcher dr paul steele steele a senior research scientist at csiro marine and atmospheric research says the paper isnt making any firm predictions but we are pointing to the prospect that emissions will increase he says the methane menace steele says methane is the second most important greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide some million tonnes of methane are emitted into the air each year although the atmosphere can rid itself of some of this through chemical processes including the oxidative effects of hydroxyl radicals methane can be emitted as a result of natural or human activity the primary natural source of methane is rotting wetland vegetation and belching by sheep and cattle its also produced by decaying landfill and exploitation of fossil fuels including drilling for oil and coal mining captured and marketed methane can be turned into an alternative energy source but poorly managed it escapes into the atmosphere where it can contribute to global warming its estimated to have been responsible for a fifth of the enhanced greenhouse effect over the past years steele says he says its unclear how much atmospheric methane comes from natural sources and how much from human activity we might know the total fairly well but we dont have a very good handle on how to partition the total amongst the range of sources he says but in an accompanying editorial dr jos lelieveld director of the max planck institute for chemistry in germany says about twothirds of global methane currently comes from human activity he says atmospheric methane grew at a rate of more than per decade before but dropped to almost zero by the s coal mines and wetlands steele says one of the effects of prolonged drought has been a drying up of wetlands particularly in the northern hemisphere bogs and swamps emit methane because theyve got all this rotting decaying vegetation at the base of the water he says if they dry up then the emission of methane stops or slows down the economic growth and coal mining activity of asian countries like china largely driven by the hunger for electricity appears to be making up for any deficit coal mining can release methane to the atmosphere without safeguards steele says we dont know if theyre being applied in chinas mines and to which effect this new image of the face on mars shows a remnant massif thought to have formed via landslides and debris the famous face on mars seen by some as evidence of intelligent life on the red planet can now be seen close up the european space agency has released new detailed images of the controversial facelike formation first captured by a viking orbiter at the cydonia region of mars in the face may be a popular target for orbiters nasas mars global surveyor snapped images in and but its not an easy one the site located at deg north martian latitude is often obscured by atmospheric dust and haze still after several attempts the high resolution stereo camera on board esas mars express captured a series of images with a ground resolution of approximately metres per pixel these images of the cydonia region on mars are truly spectacular says dr agustin chicarro esa mars express project scientist they not only provide a completely fresh and detailed view of an area famous to fans of space myths worldwide but also provide an impressive closeup over an area of great interest for planetary geologists chicarro and his team say the highresolution images further confirm what nasa scientists have been saying for years its not a face but a raised eroded surface nasas chief scientist for mars exploration dr jim garvin describes the formation as the equivalent of a butte or mesa such formations are common in the mars region of cydonia which is located between the planets southern highlands and northern plains convincing the true believers but then some may never be convinced since the spooky facelike structure was first photographed by nasas viking orbiter years ago the site has been the subject of breathless speculation in movies books and on the web some have argued this is a massive sculpture built by intelligent life and that surrounding conicallike structures are pyramids or remnants of a great city built by a complex civilisation attempts to say the face is just an accident of geology are often met by claims that scientists have something to hide for example in response to the nasa images released in web author richard hoagland retorted the reality is that it is highly unlikely that any of us would recognise a picture of our own grandmother if it was stretched horizontally flattened compressed and shown upside down so of course it doesnt look much like a face skull on mars in addition to the wellknown face and pyramids in the region a previously unseen skullshaped structure also appears in some of the new mars express images some may be eager to offer up theories to explain this new site garvin for his part doesnt want to discourage anyone from coming up with their own explanations please realise that as a scientist of martian landscapes my position is that of a traditional scientist and requires that i utilise the paradigms associated with multipleworking hypotheses grounded in the physics of landscape development he says other opinions on the basis of other approaches are of course welcome and encouraged alien face or eroded surface the face on mars is of interest to planetary geologists like garvin and these latest images reveal new geological details the latest images show the beginnings of what are called debris aprons or gentle landslides surrounding hills since the debris apron around the face is minor the scientists suggest former larger debris aprons may have been covered by lava flows meanwhile the photographs show that the western wall of the face appears to have moved down as a huge mass the same massive rock movements can be seen at the base of the surrounding pyramidlike formations as for the skulllike formation chicarro and his team suggest this is the remnant of an eroded massif thats their theory at least dogs like sports celebrities too they watch other dogs play fight then hang out with the winners dogs seem to enjoy watching other dogs compete against each other and gravitate towards the winners at the end of the game according to a recent study the uk researchers who publish their research in the journal animal behaviour believe their discovery is the first demonstration of any animal eavesdropping play in this case dogs appear to gain information about another dog or humans social status and ability just by watching that individual compete pooches excitedly rush toward victors when games finish not unlike enthusiastic human sports fans at a stadium i believe that within the context of a game dogs prefer winners because they are likely to be a fun and effective partner with which to play says lead author dr nicola rooney one plausible function of play is that it serves as a safe context in which to test ones own competitive ability an animal will learn more from playing with an able partner than with a lower quality one adds rooney a researcher in the anthrozoology institute at the university of bristol she and colleague dr john bradshaw studied canine spectators in a group that included labrador retrievers springer spaniels and one golden retriever in an initial experiment a dog was matched with a human competitor in a tug of war contest over a knotted rope toy each of the canine spectators was brought in on a leash to view matches for some games the human competitor made it clear that he or she was playing by performing moves that dogs seem to associate with playtime these include play bows where the person gets down on all fours with their forequarters lowered and arms outstretched forward lunges where the individual makes sudden yet nonthreatening movements toward the dog competitor and feet shuffling which involves rapid movement of the feet while in a standing position after such competitions the spectator canine would rapidly approach the human or doggy winner with a cheerful gait holding its ears and tail up signifying a desire to interact with the victor when playful moves were omitted from matches dogs were not as attracted to winners since they probably thought the games were real competitions and the winner might pose a threat during a followup experiment rooney and bradshaw repeated the first part of the study only this time the spectator dog was confined to a crate and only heard the proceedings after matches the listeners still gravitated toward the winner which suggests that audio cues and possibly other asyet unidentified cues such as smells might also allow dogs to identify winners and losers the research was partly funded by the waltham centre for pet nutrition the research centre of a popular pet food company in related research the scientists also determine that dogs like to win games and that winning seems to improve the animals social skills such as their playful attentionseeking behaviours rooney says she therefore advises that dog owners allow their pets to win at least some games so long as play signals are included in the competitions but not everyone loves a winner studies over the past decade on siamese fighting fish show that fish watching battles are more likely to approach losers than winners probably because they view the winners as possible rivals characters from star trek had similar adventures to the heroes of ancient mythology star trek heralded real developments in science and drew on the great classical myths an australian researcher says dr djoymi baker a selfconfessed trekkie from the university of melbourne watched more than episodes of the cult tv series as part of her phd baker an expert in media and popular culture says scientists often dismiss science fiction for getting it wrong but she says it can foreshadow or even influence developments in science adding that more members of the public watch science fiction than science factual because its gone on for so many decades star trek has had a big impact on what people think about space and what might be possible in the future she says a lot of nasa astronauts cite it as their inspiration scientists have cited it as their inspiration for new technology for example nasas first shuttle of was named enterprise after a campaign by star trek fans the star trek influence can also be seen in new spray on drug delivery technologies the computer chip and even the fliptop mobile phone and automatic doors she says and after the catchphrase beam me up scotty scientists have started to experiment with dematerialising and rematerialising helium and cloning laser beams they cant beam you up yet but theyre starting to do experiments along those lines baker says while star trek described life in the future it also had what is now regarded as a quaint precopernican tendency to place humans at the centre of the universe she says back to the future baker says star trek still holds a huge fascination even as space authorities like nasa fight for funds recognition and good publicity scientists often dont like science fiction because it can get it wrong but on the other hand it can be very inspirational she says nasa might be struggling but on the other hand we have science fiction which says we can achieve great things in space not only in terms of exploration but in terms of what sort of race we want to be and thats quite a powerful message baker says star trek not only looks forward to the technological future but harks back to the heroic past of ancient myths like homers odyssey not only do mythical figures like the amazons the god apollo or the sirens of homeric lore appear in space but star trek contains the sweeping themes of intrepid adventure and bold exploration that lie at the heart of classical mythology mythology is a bit of a recurring theme in science fiction television shows baker says just as you might have met strange creatures in an ancient myth instead you find strange creatures in outer space shows like star trek were also an indirect offshoot from the great cinematic sword and sandal epics of the s and s she says mostly tv was constrained by much tighter budgets so it just couldnt do those types of spectacles she says so myth goes into other genres and one of the genres is science fiction instead of going into the ancient past you fast forward into the future higher temperatures may change the strength of el nintildeos scientists report earth may be close to the warmest it has been in the past million years especially in the part of the pacific ocean where potentially violent el nintildeo weather patterns are born climate scientists report this doesnt necessarily mean there will be more frequent el nintildeos which can disrupt normal weather around the world but it could mean that these wild patterns will be stronger when they occur says dr james hansen of nasa goddard institute for space studies the el nintildeo phenomenon is an important factor in monitoring global warming according to a paper by hansen and colleagues in the current issue of the proceedings of the national academy of sciences el nintildeos can push temperatures higher than they might ordinarily be this happened in when a socalled superel nintildeo helped to heat the earth to the highest since records began what is significant the scientists write is that is in the same temperature range as and was among the warmest year ever on record with no sign of the warm surface water in the eastern equatorial pacific typical of an el nintildeo the waters of the western equatorial pacific are warmer than in the eastern equatorial pacific and the difference in temperature between these two areas could produce greater temperature swings between the normal weather pattern and el nintildeo they write they blame this phenomenon on climate change which they say is affecting the surface of the western pacific before it affects the deeper water el nintildeo and climate change overall earth is within degc of its highest temperature levels in the past million years hansen and the others write they note a recent steep rise in average temperatures with global surface temperatures increasing about degc for each of the past three decades many scientists attribute this rise to human activities notably the release into the atmosphere of greenhouse gases that let in sunlight and trap its heat like the glass walls of a greenhouse humancaused global warming influences el nintildeos much as it sways tropical storms the scientists write the effect on frequency of either phenomenon is unclear depending on many factors but the intensity of the most powerful events is likely to increase as greenhouse gases increase they write slowing the growth rate of greenhouse gases should diminish the probability of both superel nintildeos and the most intense tropical storms in an example of collaborative middle east science israeli and palestinian researchers are changing female nile tilapia fish into males to boost food supplies researchers in israel the palestinian territories and germany want to transform female freshwater fish into males a sex change they hope will put bigger fish on the dinner table male fish are larger grow faster and weigh about a third more than females says assistant professor mutaz qutob a palestinian researcher involved in the experiments as part of a project with hebrew university of jerusalem and germanys university of hohenheim qutob and his colleagues will inject compounds from plants found in the occupied west bank and often used as seasonings into food fed to newborn nile tilapia fish this will have an effect on the fishs metabolic structure it may shift from female to male says qutob a chemist at alquds university in east jerusalem this is a very important project we are introducing a new food source for the palestinians scientists at hebrew university have previously used synthetic steroids which are regarded as less healthy to create male fish says dr berta sivan a researcher at the israeli university which helped found the project palestinians in the west bank import most of their fish from israel and the coastal gaza strip but their consumption of fish especially those from freshwater sources has fallen in recent years due to rising costs and tighter israeli travel and trade restrictions on palestinians we wanted to solve a fishbreeding problem in israel and help bring in and promote fish consumption in the palestinian authority sivan says while israel has been building a controversial separation barrier in the west bank cooperation between israeli and palestinian academics has been growing over the past few years despite a palestinian uprising that began in israelis and palestinians who cooperate on research tend to try to work harder during politically critical times says professor hassan dweik a codirector of the israelipalestinian science organization which helps find funding for such studies the organisation this year received proposals for academic projects to be conducted by israeli and palestinian researchers on topics related to agriculture education the environment and medicine israelis and palestinians usually conduct their research separately and discuss it by phone or online due to the israeli travel restrictions that also ban most israelis from entering palestiniancontrolled areas this contour map which illustrates the shape of the poplar panel on which the mona lisa was painted shows there is most warping near the left shoulder leonardo da vincis mona lisa originally wore a delicate maternity garment and her hair was gathered up in a bun d imaging shows these details which had disappeared under varnish have now been revealed using a colour laser scanner that imaged the painting to a resolution finer than the width of a human hair researchers of the national research council canada nrc announced their findings this week this is the mona lisa as we have never seen her before says nrc president dr pierre coulombe nrc researchers travelled to paris to conduct the research on probably the louvre museums most viewed painting they did this at the request of the french state museum agencys centre for research and restoration the d scans reveal that the woman with the enigmatic smile was originally painted with her hair tied back in a bun even though today it appears loose on her shoulders the revelation settles an old controversy because only girls or women of bad virtue wore their hair loose in th century italy says project leader bruno mottin from the state museum agency the real mona lisa was a woman of social stature one of her garments similar to fashions that pregnant or nursing women wore in this period was also lost under yellow varnish and no longer visible to the naked eye the infrared scans show this is something that had never been seen until now mottin says the real mona lisa had three children da vinci was commissioned by wealthy florentine businessman francesco del giocondo to paint his wife between and after the birth of their second child but da vinci kept the painting and worked on it until his death probably changing her hair and other features in the original mona lisa the subject gripped her chair more tightly and she is not resting against the back of her chair as some believed but sitting upright the scans show researchers also gleaned insights about the da vincis painting technique including his sfumato or smoke technique of soft heavily shaded modelling says mottin there is no special mystery in the painting like in dan browns book the da vinci code he says but in that painting leonardo tried to capture the essence of life it embodies all his skills that is the true mystery weve uncovered researchers identified a lack of brushstrokes suggesting that da vinci may have used his fingers to paint except there are no fingerprints on the artwork scans of the mona lisa reveal that darker areas such as the eyes and corners of her smile are thicker and composed of a succession of thinly applied glaze layers says nrc scientist franccedilois blais but how da vinci actually applied his layers of pigment and oil medium remains a mystery he says its extremely thinly painted and extremely flat and yet the details of the curls of hair for example are extremely distinct so the technique is unlike anything weve ever seen before says john taylor of the nrc split in the painting a centimetre split at the top of the painting which worried curators appears to be stable nrc scientists say it was probably caused by the removal of the original frame and repaired between the middle of the th and beginning of the th century they say also the poplar wood panel on which da vinci painted his masterwork has a convex warp on the middle right side that is millimetres higher than its surroundings researchers say but it does not threaten the mona lisa smile the d scans were done over two nights in october before the painting was placed in a new glass display case at the louvre the scanner recorded the d shape and colour of the painting at a resolution of micrometres and a depth of micrometres mottin says although the mona lisa is seen by seven million visitors to the museum a year scientists have had few opportunities to study her in a laboratory they studied her once in the s in and now she suffers from her celebrity he says the new images will allow curators to continue their research without touching the canvas as well as try new restoration techniques on the d model before applying them to the actual portrait says taylor the canadian camera technology has been used to scan michelangelos statue david and paintings by artists like renoir and corot it was also used to create animation for hollywood movies such as peter jacksons lord of the rings trilogy and on board the nasa space shuttle atlantis to examine the changing state of the shuttles heat tiles during a mission downloading information to your mobile phone may be a case of pointing it at a building and clicking one day youll be able to point your mobile phone at a train station click and download a timetable or point it at a museum to download a list of exhibits researchers say thats the idea behind dr federico casalegnos electronic lens or elens project at the massachusetts institute of technology you could also use the phone to contribute to conversation threads similar to those on internet forums about a particular business or institution for example you could submit or retrieve a movie review at a movie theatre its a layer of electronic information on physical places says casalegno a research scientist at mit as well as a userexperience manager at motorola the approach could change both how institutions deliver information to the public and how people interact with public and private businesses in their neighbourhood casalegnos idea for the project began with the metaphor of an electronic lens that when aimed at a building could become a kind of viewfinder making the institution more transparent the technology consists of three parts a barcodelike tag that is placed on places of interest software called radioactive that is installed on the mobile phone and the social networking website constellation to use the system someone would first stick the tag on a building for example the manager of a movie theatre could stick the tag on the outside of the building then take a picture of it with a mobile phone next the manager would launch the radioactive program which would ask him or her to name the tag and provide its location the software automatically locates the tag on a map then the manager can create a message that contains text audio pictures or video there could be a tag for each movie playing in the theatre with each tag hosting a movie trailer with show times viewers with the same software on their phone can access the tag and start a conversation thread with movie reviews the manager can also use the constellation social networking website to give certain groups access to the tags perhaps there is a promotional discount for students of a particular university more than movies the technology could work for more than movies people could place their own tags around town to open up public dialogues about parks or city schools they could even use the tags inside a building such as a hospital to provide information to select groups such as doctors nurses or visitors its very convincing this idea of connecting social networks with the mobile community says leda guidi head of the citizens communication unit for the city of bologna italy who organised the countrys first free municipal internet network not only does it open up more channels of communication says guidi it could make commerce and government more accessible casalegno has already conducted a user study of people in spain and is now working on a new version of elens to be tested by next year with participants in boston or chicago this could mean that soon pointing and clicking will not be limited to the laptop artists impression of the core of the telescope australia and southern africa have been shortlisted to host a new radio telescope that is times more powerful than any that exist today the shortlist for the international square kilometre array ska telescope was announced in the netherlands this week the telescope will use lowfrequency radio waves to probe deep into the cosmos and aid the study of pulsars colliding black holes dark energy and the influence of magnetic fields on the development of stars and galaxies and it will allow detection of any radar signals from extraterrestrial intelligence that might be lurking in our galaxy it is going to provide us with a whole new window on the universe says ska steering committee member professor brian boyle from csiro the ska telescope is not a single giant instrument but a set of thousands of antennas spread out in a spiral over kilometres with antennas at the centre closest together in australia the proposed site for the core of the telescope is at mileura station kilometres northeast of perth in western australia antennas will be distributed across the continent possibly extending to new zealand in southern africa the core of the telescope would be sited in the northern cape region of south africa with dishes extending to botswana namibia mozambique madagascar mauritius kenya and ghana a bid from china was rejected because the proposed site for the core was not flat enough says boyle and a joint bid from argentina and brazil was eliminated because of turbulent ionospheric conditions above south america that would interfere with the lowfrequency radio waves used by the ska international committee boyle says the shortlist decision was made by the ska steering committee which has members including two australians one south african and one chinese member the committee oversees and coordinates research and will eventually pull together a single design for the telescope although some countries have more members on the committee than others boyle says the decision was made on a purely scientific and technical basis he also says australia should be selected as the final site i passionately believe that australia is the best site for the ska from a scientific basis he says so far australia has built a small prototype telescope at the core site called the mileura widefield array supported by us investment the final decision is expected towards the end of the decade and the telescope is expected to cost billion euros a billion in total despite the tens of millions already spent on developing ska technology and telescope design in australia and even if it isnt the final location australia astronomers will still be ahead boyle says he says the money spent has already improved australias radio astronomy capability and the effort has developed australian expertise in radio telescope design and radio astronomy itself and wherever the telescope is built boyle says astronomers will be able to access it remotely from their desktop via broadband networks from wherever they are in the world surgeons performing the first zerogravity operation aboard a plane freefalling to create weightless conditions they hope this can be a trial run for surgery on astronauts in space french doctors this week carried out the worlds first operation on a human in zero gravity using a specially adapted aircraft to simulate conditions in space during a threehour flight from bordeaux in southwest france the team of surgeons and anaesthetists successfully removed a benign tumour from the forearm of a yearold volunteer the experiment was part of a program backed by the european space agency to develop techniques for performing robotic surgery aboard the international space station or at a future moon base we werent trying to perform technical feats but to carry out a feasibility test now we know that a human being can be operated on in space without too many difficulties says team leader dr dominique martin under normal ground conditions the operation would be a straightforward procedure performed under a local anaesthetic without gravity the surgeons work is harder and the patients body reacts differently cardiac output is reduced which creates vascular stress blood doesnt pump in the same way above all it flows out of a wound in spheres so we had to create a special vacuum aspirator to contain it martin told the french newspaper liberation the customdesigned airbus aircraft dubbed zerog performed a series of parabolic swoops creating between seconds of weightlessness at the top of each curve the process was repeated times strapped inside a custommade operating block three surgeons and two anaesthetists worked during these brief bursts with their instruments held in place with magnets around the patients stretcher if we had had two hours of zero gravity at a stretch we could have removed an appendix says martin head of bordeaux university hospitals plastic surgery unit a similar experiment was carried out in october but the operation then was to mend a millimetrewide artery in a rats tail the next phase of the program is to carry out a remotecontrolled operation using a robot controlled from the ground by satellite this experiment should take place within a year martin says anaesthetist dr laurent de coninck says that zerogravity surgery offers huge promise for space exploration although it would at first be limited to treating simple injuries today more than people have already travelled into space the chances of injuries occurring during missions will become ever greater and to bring a wounded person back to earth for treatment is both risky for them and expensive he says world space agencies hope that by a permanently inhabited base can be established on the moon to conduct research and exploit lunar resources researchers would learn to live off the lunar land and test technologies for voyages to mars in the shorter term prebuilt robotic surgical blocks could also have valuable uses here on earth for instance inside caves or locations that are difficult to access such as after an earthquake longdistance flights to mars will not be happening in the immediate future says guy laslandes head of the ariane v program at frances national centre for space studies but the experiment will allow the development of working methods and miniaturised tools that can be used in extreme conditions on earth such as during missions to the north pole this costa rican zebra tarantula has an archaic way of sticking to surfaces tarantulas secrete sticky silk from their feet to help them adhere to shiny surfaces says an international team of scientists spiders are already known to have two mechanisms that allow them to walk upside or cling to smooth vertical surfaces one is the use of thousands of tiny hairs that generate a weak electrical bond using van der waals forces with the surface another is tiny claws that lock onto rough surfaces but scientists at the max planck institute for metals research in stuttgart and us colleagues have now found in tarantulas at least there is a third gripping tool tarantulas have microscopic nozzlelike structures on their feet that secrete a viscous silklike filament the researchers report their results today in the journal nature the team carried out its research with zebra tarantulas aphonopelma seemanni from costa rica which were induced to walk around a slick vertical glass surface to walk up the spiders used their distal claws to keep a grip to walk down they exuded fibres between and micrometres in diameter from all four pairs of feet that adhered to the glass and stopped them sliding and falling the german team led by dr stanislav gorb at the institutes evolutionary biomaterials group says the new discovery raises questions about spiders evolutionary past arachnids also have an abdominal pouch a spinneret which produces the silk to make webs gorb theorises that spiders may have started making silk with their feet before they began to do so with their spinnerets as this would have helped their survival by avoiding catastrophic falls the next step is to carry out a genetic analysis of the foot silk proteins to compare it to the spinneret silk proteins industrial chemists study spider silk as they are eager to make a synthetic copy that mimics its strength and resilience since ancient times people have dyed their grey hair black a yearold recipe for hair dye shows ancient greeks and romans used nanotechnology to permanently colour grey hair black say experts dr philippe walter of the french state museum agencys centre for research and restoration and colleagues report their findings online in the journal nano letters the researchers made up a batch of dye according to a recipe used since grecoroman times which includes a mixture of lead oxide and slaked lime they soaked milligrams of blond human hair in the dye for three days then studied the hair closely the hair turned progressively black and when the researchers took crosssections of hair and studied it under the microscope they found nanocrystals of lead sulfide inside the hair shaft the lead in the lead oxide had reacted with sulfur from the amino acids found in hair keratins the scientists say giving the black colour they say the nanometre lead sulfide crystals look very much like lead sulfide quantum dots that are made today by advanced materials science methods the researchers say their discovery might help develop new mineralbased nanomaterials dr ivan kempson a materials scientist and research fellow at the university of south australia is impressed with the research its the highest resolution and most detailed study of the incorporation of a metal like lead into hair he says kempson says the findings are interesting for his own work which looks at how hair takes up metals from the environment but he says it is not yet clear how the sulfur in the keratin is made available to interact with the lead in the hair kempson says the research is also of interest to the cosmetics industry in developing hair dyes if you know how they penetrate the hair and how they react within the hair then you can develop better cosmetic products he says the research team includes a member from loreacuteal cosmetics company one day you might be greeted by a talking thinking computeranimated face like this one when booking a ticket or withdrawing money from the bank talking thinking cartoon faces that understand our needs may one day improve our chances of getting what we want from computers say experts the animated faces may replace the mouse keyboard and the touch screen as the main way we interact with computers say when booking tickets or withdrawing money from the bank professor denis burnham director of the marcs auditory laboratories at the university of western sydney says a talking thinking head could be available in the next years at the moment we use keyboards and mouses to communicate says burnham a behavioural psychologist but what people really want with computers is that they actually understand what youre doing and know what you want and can interact with you a lot more effectively and naturally burnham is heading up a new a million us million project funded by the australian research council and the national health and medical research council to develop a computergenerated head that emulates facetoface conversation burnhams team will use technologies such as computer animation speech recognition and computergenerated dialogue to construct the talking thinking head and the researchers will use cognitive science to evaluate and improve how well it communicates frustrated from the word processors irritating paper clip man to frustrating telephone automated directory services success so far in this arena has been somewhat limited burnham hopes his teams talking thinking head will make our conversations with artifically intelligent machines more effective for two reasons first it will include visual cues such as different mouth shapes and face expressions that help us understand what is being said second the head will be capable of tailoring its communication to different types of people by accessing different databases it would select articulation intonation facial expression or vocabulary to best suit the person its talking to says burnham he says such a head on a videophone could make automated directory assistance more effective at communicating with children or people with accents or hearing disabilities it might also remember different individuals and personalise its interactions with them and have appropriate emotional responses when the need arises burnham says the head might even switch to sympathetic mode when we get irate with it for not understanding us correctly learning all the time burnham says he plans to develop a head that is also able to learn from its interactions with different people and improve its communication he says current prototype heads are used in tourist information kiosks for ticketing and language instruction one project is also exploring the use of a talking thinking head as a personal companion and minder for elderly or disabled people burnham says the project will initially explore two scenarios where the head might be useful dealing with billing complaints and language tuition dust mites and their faeces contain an enzyme that destroys the protective function of the skin leaving it open to other irritants dust mites which infest the cleanest homes and thrive in bedding and carpets disrupt the protective function of the skin a study has found this leaves it vulnerable to other allergens and irritants in the environment house dust mites and their droppings have long been linked to asthma and eczema attacks and researchers in japan say they think they know why in a paper to be published in the journal of investigative dermatology the researchers found that mites and their faeces contain an enzyme which destroys the protective function of the skin leaving it vulnerable to other irritants people go to hospital only after they develop severe skin disease but little is known as to what happened or what caused it says assistant professor toshiro takai of the atopy research centre at the juntendo university school of medicine in tokyo our study suggests that it may be due to the disruption of the barrier function of the skin by the dust mite in their experiment the scientists dabbed hairless mice with a solution containing the mite enzyme and observed that the rodents soon suffered water loss from their skins they then dabbed the mice with riboflavin or vitamin b which is accepted in the scientific community as a substitute for allergens and irritants in the environment we observed in the mice transepidermal water loss which is an indication of disruption of the skin barrier we also observed the penetration of riboflavin into the skin takai says takai says the finding provides an explanation for skinrelated allergies in humans and he hopes dermatologists would investigate more closely into the role of the dust mite in a healthy person the barrier is complete and irritants cant get into the skin but partial disruption of the barrier facilitates passage of allergens and other irritants he says according to the world health organization who asthma affected million people worldwide in killing of them the death figure is expected to increase by in years time if urgent action if not taken the who says say cheese research that calculates the number of photos you need to take to make sure no one in the group has their eyes closed has won two australians an ig nobel award nic svenson and dr piers barnes of csiro industrial physics have been awarded the ig nobel prize for mathematics at a ceremony at harvard university i end up doing a lot of group photographs and the number of people blinking in photographs is driving me nuts says svenson a csiro communications officer so she thought there had to be some kind of rule to figure out how many photographs to take to make sure she got a good one svenson researched basic information on how long a blink lasts how many times people blink per minute and how fast camera shutters go barnes a physicist worked out that blinks are random and that one persons blinks dont influence another persons blinks and unless you have got something stuck in your eye your blinks dont influence each other either he came up with a graph showing the probability of having someone blink in a photograph says svenson then he was able to do the reverse of that equation as it were to come up with the number of photographs to take the two found out that when youre taking photos of a group with fewer than people you divide the number of people by three to get the number of shots you need to take but in bad light the camera shutter is open for longer and this gives people more of a chance to blink while a photo is taken so in bad light you need to divide the number of people by two to get the number of shots as the size of the group increases the number of shots you need to take increases exponentially says svenson and by the time there are around people in the group she says you can kiss your hopes of an unspoilt photo goodbye fingernails scraping on a blackboard the winner for the ig nobel prize for acoustics went to three scientists who investigated responses to the sound of fingernails scraping on a blackboard the study called psychoacoustics of a chilling sound found that scraping fingernails was the most annoying sound out of sounds tested it was much more annoying for example than the sound of a dragged stool a metal drawer being opened scraping wood scraping metal or rubbing together two pieces of polystyrene foam the research which was published in the journal perception and psychoacoustics in the s concludes that acoustic energy in the middle range of frequencies audible to humans is the culprit but it could not answer why such sounds were so grating to the ear teen repellents and headachefree woodpeckers still on acoustics the ig nobel peace prize went to the developers of a device that makes an annoying noise that teenagers can hear but not adults the device which emits a superhighpitched mosquitolike buzz was originally used as an electromechanical teenager repellent and later used for telephone ringtones that teenagers could hear but not their teachers still on mosquitoes the ig nobel prize for biology went to researchers who reported in the lancet that the female malaria mosquito anopheles gambiae is attracted to the smell of limburger cheese just as much as to the smell of human feet the ig nobel prize for medicine went to the authors of case reports in medical journals on the termination of intractable hiccups with digital rectal massage the winner of the ig nobel prize for ornithology was a professor of ophthalmology who helped explain why woodpeckers dont get headaches the ig nobel prizes honour achievements that first make people laugh and then make them think they are produced by the science humour magazine the annals of improbable research mature cells retain the genetic capacity to grow into all cell types needed to regenerate an entire organism scientists say scientists say they have cloned mice from white blood cells with a similar technique used to create dolly the sheep the us researchers who publish their results online in the journal nature genetics say their method shows it is possible to clone animals from mature cells they say their findings counter the argument that truly mature tissue is too old to be regenerated dr jerry yang of the university of connecticut dr tao cheng of the university of pittsburgh and colleagues cloned mice using fully differentiated or mature white blood cells called granulocytes they used somatic cell nuclear transfer in which the nucleus from a cell of the animal to be cloned is injected into an egg whose nucleus has been removed this process works very poorly in mice and usually a twostep procedure is needed first growing tiny embryos then removing their embryonic stem cells to generate mouse pups yangs team tried cloning using the blood cells at various levels of development from the stem cells stage through to full maturity called full differentiation what was surprising the efficiency went up as we got more differentiated cells yang says that was very very surprising very shocking to us only the fully mature granulocytes were able to produce two live cloned pups although both died within a few hours of birth the researchers report even we were surprised to find fully differentiated cells were more efficient for cloning because granulocytes are not capable of dividing cheng says in fact we repeated our experiments six times just to be sure now we can say with near certainty that a fully differentiated cell such as a granulocyte retains the genetic capacity for becoming like a seed that can give rise to all cell types necessary for the development of an entire organism the study may support the hopes of researchers who want to use cloning technology in medicine supporters of socalled therapeutic cloning want to some day be able to take a single cell from a patient perhaps a skin cell and use it to generate tailormade tissue or organ transplants to do so fully mature cells must maintain the ability to regress and be reprogrammed the way we relate to family members is culturally determined but is this also reflected in brain activity the culture you are born into influences the way your brain works an australian conference has heard juan dominguez a phd student at the university of melbourne discussed the effects of enculturation on the human brain at a recent anthropology conference in cairns the researcher believes different cultures produce different brains and that cultural differences reflect different neurological functioning in certain societies and cultures there are certain patterns of behaviour people may make certain evaluations have certain opinions there are certain tasks that are culturally specific he says we should be able to find that the brain would have some sort of bias acquired through exposure to culture dominguez is piloting a brain scanning study in which he will test how people from different cultures react when they are shown photos of family members he believes the differing kinship relations will be reflected in different types of brain activity dr douglas lewis a senior lecturer at anthropology who is supervising the work acknowledges this is a controversial area but lewis says there is no suggestion that one culture is smarter or better than another rather the emerging science of neuroanthropology suggests that brains within a group can be wired by common experience just as individual brains become wired by individual experiences what were looking for are correlates in the brain that anthropologists have in the past thought of as being cultural or culturally mediated he says recognising faces the study will test brain function in an indian tamil and an australian of anglosaxon descent he says while western cultures call both maternal and paternal uncles uncle other cultures including tamil call paternal uncles father and reserve uncle for maternal uncles you may have a distant relationship with your father and a closer relationship with your uncle dominguez says this could bias the way in which the way brain develops because the parts that modulate emotions may be engaged in certain ways hell test this by showing the subjects photographs of relations and monitoring their brain activity with magnetic resonance imaging we think that there will be patterns of activity that will be different he says how does experience shape our brain dominguez says the human brain is plastic and responds to its environment in the way connections form between brain cells these connections are influenced by repeated patterns of thought emotional reinforcement and even the influence of chemicals associated with stress and pleasure on the brain the brain is an experience acquisition device that goes beyond genetic constraints he says it is always engaged in generating and pruning connections lewis says the constant process of wiring and rewiring makes every brain unique the number of potential connections between neurones in the neocortex alone exceeds the number of atoms in the physical universe he says that means there are potentially that many brains and were looking at certain groups or clusters the principle can apply to peer groups and subcultures as well if youre hanging out with the hiphop scene youre going to pick up patterns of thought ways of thinking expectations of other peoples behaviour that are different from your next door neighbour whos a retired factory worker he says textiles made from feathers may be lightweight good insulators and cushion impact chicken feathers and rice straw are being turned into fabric fibres that resemble wool linen and cotton scientists say the textiles may help reduce not only agricultural waste but also our reliance on petroleumbased synthetic fabrics some of all fibres are from petroleum and we have an oil issue says yiqi yang a professor of textile science at the university of nebraskalincoln who is collaborating with doctoral candidate narendra reddy yang and his colleagues think that agricultural waste could offer an alternative source rice straw is made up of the bits and stems left over after a rice harvest and like cotton and flax is composed mostly of cellulose it now accounts for about million tonnes of waste worldwide chicken feathers which are composed of keratin like wool make up about billion kilograms in waste each year in the us much of this material ends up in landfill according to yang even processing a small fraction of this agricultural waste and turning it into textiles could have a significant impact on world demand which totals about million tonnes of fibres a year yangs team has already conducted research on developing fibres from rice straw hes a leader in this kind of research says jonathan chen associate professor at louisiana state university in baton rouge first collect your rice straw just like cotton the rice straw is harvested baled shipped to a plant and broken down into tiny pieces the straw is treated with a combination of chemicals heat and enzymes and washed repeatedly the process breaks down the straw separating the cellulose fibres from other natural materials these materials include hemicellulose a carbohydrate silica a hard mineral substance and lignin a polymer that hardens and strengthens plant cell walls the process of extracting the fibres is under patent review and so yang is reluctant to describe it in too much detail but he says that it is not complicated or expensive the number one challenge is the costeffectiveness for utilising these kinds of waste materials says chen if you can compete with current available products you will have a chance fluffy feathers research for processing fibres from the chicken feathers is not as advanced as the rice straw research so far yang and his team have characterised the fibre properties of feathers to determine the best applications they have focused on the thin filamentous parts that form the fluffier parts of the feather these parts have microscopic air pockets interlaced within a honeycomb architecture those properties could offer fibres that are lightweight good insulators and cushion impact the biggest hurdle may be getting the textile industry to accept chicken and rice fibres yang expects the driving force to come from the clothing industry where people are always looking out for durable inexpensive natural textiles she might be laughing but her brain is really picking out mismatches laughter involves a unique form of consciousness says an australian researcher who is trying to unravel the thought patterns that underpin humour ann hale a medical anthropologist from the university of sydney spoke about the social and cultural context of laughter at a recent conference of the australian anthropological society in cairns she believes jokes rely on the juxtapositioning of two mismatched or incompatible concepts for example she tells the joke about the prisoner who plays cards with his wardens but the prisoner cheats so they kick him out of prison prisons have rules that they lock you up hale says but if you cheat you get kicked out so you have two concepts there the same applies to slapstick humour she says when we laugh at someone falling over its not the process of falling that tickles our funny bone but the attempt to stay upright what makes people laugh at slapstick is not falling off the tightrope but what you do to stay on she says weve got an idea that this is what you look like when youre upright and heres somebody trying to stay upright its within the same concept but its incongruous its the mismatch its not the fact that youve fallen onto your backside even babies do it research has shown we instinctively recognise these incompatible contexts in the first year of life hale says research shows that if a mother crawls towards the edge of the cot the baby will laugh because it interferes with the convention that babies crawl mothers walk she says it also suggests that we respond to contextual mismatches without having to get the joke hale says these thought processes have been compared to the reactions of highly trained sportspeople like the tennis player who is in position to return a serve before the brain kicks in laughter is essential because it provides a cognitive respite hales says laughter offers a temporary respite from the everyday clutter of thought its a different sort of consciousness with is uncluttered by the everyday shoulds and buts she says hale believes laughter is a uniquely human talent that operates within a cultural context but also transcends culture its a kind of perception a recognition she says understanding laughter and humour might get us closer to looking at what consciousness is and providing another paradigm rna interference silences genes and so stops dna from encoding genetic information rna interference whose discovery brought us scientists professors andrew fire and craig mello the nobel prize in medicine is one of the hottest new areas of biotechnology and has spawned its own miniindustry the two researchers discovered that certain types of rna could silence genes turning them off and altering a cells functions rna or ribonucleic acid is the molecule that transmits the genetic information encoded in dna plants use the rna interference or rnai mechanism to fight off viruses and the discovery is being exploited by labs and companies around the world to try to find cures for cancer certain types of blindness and even bird flu its a classic example of basic research which has turned out to uncover a biological mechanism which now has tremendous potential for really impacting human health says dr jeremy berg head of the us national institute of general medical sciences which funded fire and mellos work mello a professor of molecular medicine at the university of massachusetts medical school and fire a professor at stanford university school of medicine made their discovery in the late s in the pair published their discovery in the journal nature and in the journal science named rnai as the breakthrough of the year clinical trials trials using rna interference to treat people are already under way it has led to clinical trials on agerelated macular degeneration but also there are trials for diabetes and hiv and influenza and most anything you can imagine where we know enough to know that overexpression of particular genes is important berg says cancer for example is often caused by overactive genes and quelling their activity could halt the disease his institute says rna interference can also stop hiv polio hepatitis c and other viruses it is also an incredibly powerful research tool berg adds researchers can use it to turn off or turn down a gene and see what happens flipping the off switch every cell in the body carries the complete genetic code written in dna these genes cannot all be firing full blast at the same time so in each type of cell some genes are turned on or expressing and most of the others are off if you can think of a flood coming out of your kitchen sink to the kitchen floor todays medicines simply act like a mop and mop up the water with rna interference we can shut off the tap says dr john maraganore chief executive of massachusettsbased alnylam pharmaceuticals alnylam is working with merck and co medtronic novartis biogen idec and the us government to develop rnai to treat high cholesterol respiratory syncytial virus which can endanger infants hn avian influenza the ebola virus and some types of pain at least different companies are focusing on rna interference either for therapy or research but analysts caution that technical problems and safety concerns remain to be resolved before rnai therapies enter the medical vocabulary one problem faced by researchers is how to get the interfering rna molecules into the body effectively and different companies are taking different approaches dublinbased company research and markets estimated the total value of the rnai industry at us billion in websites are changing the way musicians promote music and network with other artists musicians tend to hang out with artists who play in a different style rather than those from the same genre an international study of online social networks has found the study tells us how musical genres evolve and the part that online networking plays in how people produce promote and listen to music researchers reporting on the arxiv physics website created two datasets based on information from the music website allmusiccom the first group which they call the collaboration network consists of artists who have worked together such as mick jagger and keith richards the second group or similarity network includes artists who share an element of musical similarity and puts mick jagger in with tina turner and david bowie an analysis of the groups shows little correspondence between artists who play together and artists who make the same sort of music suggesting that musicians are more likely to collaborate with others from different musical genres collaboration is not the mechanism for similarity spreading and playing similar music is not an ingredient to predict collaboration links the authors from the university of michigan the universitat pompeu fabra and the universidad rey juan carlos in spain conclude collaboration networks jean burgess is an australian phd student at the queensland university of technology qut who has researched online and offline musician communities she says the studys collaboration network reveals something about the nature of how musical genres evolve theres no necessary relationship between the style of music you play and who you play music with burgess says music has always been a really social practice and musicians will tend to work together on more of a social basis this is how new genres have formed and reformed throughout history on the basis of people from different musical styles playing together burgess says online networking has had a big impact on musicians and how their work is produced promoted and consumed for example websites like myspace and youtube allow artists to promote their work and network at the same time the way other myspace users consume that content feeds back into the formation of social networks she says folksonomies the second network identified in the study which is based on musical similarities reflects another internetdriven development used commercially by websites like amazon says dr axel bruns also of qut the authors of the study say this can make it easier for consumers to discover new music but bruns says it can also potentially result in less choice for consumers you might end up with a situation where everyone whos a female singer songwriter might get compared to joni mitchell rather than a lesser known artist who may be a closer comparison he says bruns says categorising music by similarity rather than genre ties into the new phenomenon of folksonomies rather than having a predefined ranking which says these singers are rock or alternative or classical the categories derive from a broad user base interacting with the data he says its a democratic form of taxonomy which is more in tune with public perception this years ozone loss can be explained by the temperatures above antarctica reaching the lowest recorded in the area since antarctica in suffered its highest recorded singleyear loss in ozone says the european space agency ozone measurements made by the agencys envisat satellite shows a loss of million tonnes on october exceeding the previous record of million tonnes set in ozone loss is calculated by measuring the area and depth of the socalled ozone hole in the stratosphere about kilometres above earths surface this years ozone hole measures million square kilometres which is nearly as large as in and the depth of the ozone hole is dobson units a measurement of the thickness of the layer which rivals a record set in the agency says ozone filters out dangerous ultraviolet rays from the sun that damage vegetation and can cause skin cancer and cataracts the layer has been badly damaged by industrial chemicals especially chlorine and chlorofluorocarbons cfcs scientists say the chemical reaction that thins ozone reaches its peak with colder high altitude temperatures in the southern hemisphere winter such significant ozone loss requires very low temperatures in the stratosphere combined with sunlight says the agencys atmospheric engineer dr claus zehner this years extreme loss of ozone can be explained by the temperatures above antarctica reaching the lowest recorded in the area since last week the world meteorological organization wmo gave notice that the seasonal ozone hole in was heading for a record the ozone level globally has lowered by a year over the past decade cfcs mainly aerosol gases and refrigerants and other ozone destroyers were controlled by an international treaty the montreal protocol signed in september but there is already so much of the pollution stored in the atmosphere that large ozone holes are expected to persist for the next couple of decades the wmo says the ozone layer over the antarctic will only be completely replenished years later than predicted by according to the wmo and un environment programme ozone in the stratosphere is protective at ground level though ozone as a chemical reaction between exhaust fumes and sunlight is a pollutant that can be dangerous for people with bad respiratory or heart problems the discovery of cosmic ripples just after the big bang explains why the universe is lumpy and not a smooth sheet of matter or energy us scientists dr john mather and professor george smoot have won the nobel prize for physics for finding the background radiation that finally nailed down the big bang theory of the origin of the universe the discovery of these cosmic ripples was lauded in by cosmologist professor stephen hawking as the greatest discovery of the century if not of all time while most physicists do not go that far they are universal in their praise of the experiment in which the pair and their team designed a satellite and used it to find proof of the big bang mather from nasas goddard space flight center and smoot from university of california berkeley found faint variations in microwave radiation that dated back to just years after the fiery birth of the universe these ripples in the microwave radiation they say were the primordial framework on which the galaxies stars and other stuff of the universe took shape it explains why the universe is lumpy and not a smooth sheet of matter and energy the discovery changed everything says professor lawrence krauss a theoretical physicist at case western reserve university in ohio it produced a revolution in what we know about the universe we know it is expanding we know it is flat and we can measure that to an incredible accuracy krauss says cosmology now is a precision science until then theoretical physicists had cobbled together small pieces of evidence that the universe and everything in it had appeared suddenly about billion years ago from an infinitesimally small point in a vacuum of nothingness there was very strong theoretical prejudice against the big bang mather says the big bang was in opposition to the steady state theory but after the discovery the adherents of the steady state theory had to give up he says professor michael turner an astronomer and astrophysicist at the university of chicago says it cemented what we call the hot big bang model it opened the door to this golden age of cosmology that we are now in the findings fit the theoretical models so perfectly that they impressed even astronomers when they saw the first data in says nasas dr mary cleave he actually got a standing ovation when he announced his results she says scientists have since followed up on those measurements to try to understand for instance dark matter this is mass that no one has been able to see or measure but which must exist because of the amount of gravity measured in the universe some of the rock art on the dampier archipelago the public is being asked to comment on plans to protect whats been called the worlds largest art gallery a collection of ancient aboriginal rock art on the dampier archipelago federal environment and heritage minister senator ian campbell has called for submissions on a proposal that would see most of the area which is in northwestern australia placed on the national heritage list the proposal would hinder the development of the a billion pluto gas natural gas project by woodside energy on the burrup peninsula the australian heritage council report on the dampier archipelago which the minister released this week describes the density of rock carvings or petroglyphs and stone arrangements on the dampier as exceptional it says the depictions of animals human figures humananimal figures and geometric designs provides an outstanding opportunity to develop a scientific understanding of the social functions of motifs and it says the engravings which date back years provide an unusual and outstanding visual record of aboriginal peoples responses to the rise of sea levels at the end of the last ice age during its assessment of the dampier archipelago the council received submissions from industry and state government authorities generally opposed to heritage listing there were only two submissions in favour of listing one of these was from the local wonggoottoo aboriginal group the other from the australian rock art research association aura what the minister basically in my opinion is looking for is more support from the public says robert bednarik of aura who has been advocating on behalf of the rock art for over years senator campbell said last week he was keen to get the balance right between allowing industrial development and preserving the rock art i want to make sure that all of the major stakeholders particularly the economic stakeholders are very happy with the process and we get what i call a winwinwin he told abc radio in calling for public submissions on the proposed listing the minister drew attention to where the boundary for the protected area should be drawn agreeing to the right boundary is a key element of ensuring the heritage and economic values of the area can coexist in to the future he said but some people are concerned about any compromise that would see some of the rock art sacrificed bednarik who is also convenor of the international federation of rock art organizations says he spent three years surveying the art on the dampier archipelago you can fairly describe it as the worlds largest art gallery he says bednarik says the rock art must be preserved as a whole likening it to the uks stonehenge what if a petrochemical plant said look youve got here columns couldnt we take a few out because its in our way the world monuments fund has put the dampier archipelago on its list of of the worlds most endangered sites opposition to the listing woodside energy says it welcomes the opportunity to comment on the proposal but will oppose heritage listing as a general principle we dont doubt that the burrup is a special place says a company spokesperson but he says the listing will create uncertainty for industry in the area which could be held liable for damage to the rock art through pollution it wouldnt only hinder our project it would hinder everything the spokesperson says he describes the heritage listing as a blunt instrument because it fails to consider the economic values of the area that is the gateway to the a billion north west shelf liquefied natural gas project this is probably the most productive part of the australian land mass he says the spokesperson says the company prefers a management plan for the area produced by a coalition of state and federal government indigenous groups conservationists and industry comments on the proposal to list the dampier archipelago are to be made to the heritage assessment branch of the department of the environment and heritage by november a new type of paper made from nanowires withstands temperatures to degc tough paper that wont burn is resistant to bacteria and can be written on time and time again has been developed by us researchers the paper could be used in a range of applications say scientists from the university of arkansas in fayetteville it could be used to make products from reusable bacteria filters to flameretardant wallpaper that automatically decomposes airborne toxins alternatively it could be used to make rewritable erasable heatresistant billboards along highways its core ingredient is the key to the papers resilience while most paper is made from cellulose fibres the new material is made from nanowires of titanium dioxide a chemical compound common in white pigment the starting materials are simple nontoxic and inexpensive says dr z ryan tian assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the university the assembly is a roomtemperature casting process as simple as drying paper pulp to make the nanowires the researchers first mix powdered titanium dioxide with an alkaline solution and place it in a tefloncoated container then they heat the mixture in an oven at degc for one to several days as the alkali evaporates it leaves behind long white fibres the nanowires are washed in distilled water and when still the consistency of wet pulp cast into d shapes such as tubes bowls and cups after the paper dries it can be bent folded or trimmed with scissors the finished product can withstand temperatures of degc which makes it flameretardant it also makes it possible to sanitise the paper with a torch flame or ultraviolet light the papers properties also make it ideal for a reusable filter membrane in gas masks the researchers say the pore size of the paper can be adjusted during the casting process so that the holes are big enough to let oxygen in but small enough to block toxins this research shows a novel way of fabricating membranes made of titanium dioxide nanowires says professor zhong lin wang director for the center for nanostructure characterization and fabrication at the georgia institute of technology in atlanta in addition when photons of light hit the nanoscale fibres a charge is created that works to zap and destroy any toxins on the surface the team has applied for a patent on the process and is looking for industrial partners to license and commercialise applications of the nanopaper technology rna polymerase a crucial molecule in the multistep process that encodes genetic material into proteins roger kornberg published its structure in us scientist professor roger kornberg the son of a nobel laureate has won the nobel chemistry prize for showing how genetic information stored in genes is copied and then transferred to parts of the cell that produce proteins this process known as transcription is essential to how cells develop and life itself kornbergs prize came years after he watched his father arthur accept the medicine nobel in stockholm for his own gene work the swedish academy of sciences says kornberg juniors research into how rna or ribonucleic acid moves genetic information around the cell was of fundamental medical importance it is a key mechanism to the biological machinery if it does not work we die says professor per ahlberg a member of the nobel committee for chemistry at the academy dr elias zerhouni director of the us national institutes of health which has helped fund both kornbergs work says understanding the process may help fight disease illnesses like cancer heart disease and various other kinds of inflammation are linked to disturbances in the transcription process he says understanding this process in more detail may provide researchers with the needed tools to develop new treatments for diseases and because the transfer of information helps explain how a cell becomes a nerve or liver or muscle cell understanding transcription is crucial for the development of various therapeutic applications of stem cells xray crystallography if dna is the blueprint for life rna is the builder that has to make something out of it and kornberg figured out how this happens he used a process called xray crystallography in which molecules in a chemical reaction are frozen into crystals and photographed using xrays to capture transcription in action and in incredible detail these images showed the complex structure of rna but work was slow says kornberg who is now at stanford university school of medicine it was only possible because of advances in computing kornberg made an image of a molecule that rna uses to read and transcribe the dna code it took close to years to find a way to first see and then understand the molecule known as rna polymerase the process of transcription is one of the most fundamental biological processes says dr jeremy berg director of the national institute of general medical sciences which helped fund kornbergs work the dna double helix is a very beautiful structure but it is a challenge to deal with because all the information is inside berg says what rna polymerase has to do is somehow find the right spot and then pull the two strands of the double helix apart in the right region it has to copy the sequence very accurately it has to stop and start in the right places it has to turn on the right genes under the right circumstances berg adds kornberg senior was honoured for advancing understanding on how genetic information is transferred from a mother cell to its daughters the award makes the kornbergs the sixth fatherson pair to win nobels since the prizes were first awarded in and the eighth set of parent and child laureates artists impression of an ultrashort period planet circling its star astronomers have discovered a new class of planets outside the solar system that hug their parent stars so tightly they take less than a day to complete an orbit using nasas orbiting hubble telescope astronomers found between eight and new planets near the centre of the milky way that orbit their parent stars in as little as hours they were looking at part of the milky way known as the galactic bulge socalled because it is rich in stars and in the gas and dust that go to make up stars and planets the scientists publish their findings today in the journal nature at lightyears away they are the most distant planets yet found and a further indicator others are probably scattered throughout the milky way the researchers say this allows us to say with a high degree of confidence that there are billions of planets in our galaxy says dr mario livio an astronomer at the space telescope science institute in baltimore scientists have long conjectured that planets exist outside our solar system but they have only been able to locate them since about planets have been discovered so far many of them gas giants similar to jupiter locked in a close orbit to their parent stars those hot jupiters can be eight times closer to their parent stars than mercury is to the sun the newly discovered planets fit within that category except they move even more quickly around their parent stars which are smaller than the sun surface temperatures on those ultrashort period planets are about degc says dr kailash sahu a space telescope science institute astronomer who led the team their parent stars are so nearby they fill up onethird of the sky from the horizon to the zenith sahu says sahus team found the possible planets by looking for stars that dim when planets pass in front of them the researchers confirmed two of those as planets by examining the slight wobble of the parent star caused by the orbiting bodys gravity the other objects were too distant using other tests the team was able to say with certainty that at least a large fraction of our candidates must be planets sahu says the flowers on this dress open and close by themselves a dress with animated flowers on its neckline shirt sleeves that make sounds in tune with your body language and a hemline with a mind of its own have been developed by a canadian researcher professor joanna berzowska and international colleagues will discuss these and other examples of wearable technology at a workshop in australia next year called reskin berzowskas flowery dress named kukkia has a neckline with felt and silk flowers that open and close according to a special electronics embedded in the dress i really wanted to make these dresses that have personalities that move and behave almost like animals says berzowska who teaches computation art at concordia university in montreal the flower petals are made of silk and felt and contain thin wires of nitinol an alloy of nickel and titanium nitinol is a shape memory alloy which can be programmed to have different shapes at different temperatures when the wire heats it shrinks and pulls the petals together closing the flower as it cools down the wire relaxes and the petals open a custom electronics board is connected by embroidered conductive thread to the flowers and makes each one open and close every seconds the system is run on rechargeable lithium polymer batteries originally designed for use in model aeroplanes which are embedded in pouches in the dress another dress with a mind of its own is vilkas which has a hemline that goes up and down on its own we tend to think of consumer electronics as something we can control but berzowska says once you turn on the microcontroller in these dresses you have to surrender control i like how perverse it is to have a piece of wearable electronics that you cant control she says perhaps they dont do what you want them to do and they behave in unexpected ways on your body maybe they move at inappropriate times musical pants and sound sleeves berzowska also has musical clothes including musical pants that make a sound every time you take a step as youre walking through public space you can leave a whole trail of sounds behind you based on how youre walking she says she also has sound sleeves that produce different sounds to reflect the wearers body language the sleeves produce a higher frequency sound the harder you squeeze your arms together if someone is feeling angry or threatened they cross their arms causing the sleeves to generated an almost painfully high pitch but when you relax your arms the pitch goes down says berzowska it almost sounds like a cat purring intimate memories berzowska has another outfit called intimate memory that record acts of physical intimacy using a microphone and a series of lightemitting diodes leds stitched in a curved line across the front the leds light up when someone touches the skirt whispers something in the ear of the wearer or blows on their neck the number of lights represents the intensity of the intimacy event similar to the volume indicator on a stereo says berzowska over time the lights turn off one by one to show time elapsed since the event took place the bussized monster catching a smaller plesiosaur scientists have found a fossil of a monster fishlike reptile in a millionyearold jurassic graveyard on an arctic island off norway the norwegian researchers discovered remains of a total of plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs at a site on the island of spitsbergen about kilometres from the north pole at the time these were the top marine predators when dinosaurs dominated on land one of them was this gigantic monster with vertebrae the size of dinner plates and teeth the size of cucumbers says dr joern hurum an assistant professor at the university of oslo we believe the skeleton is intact and that its about metres long he says of the pliosaur a type of plesiosaur with a short neck and massive skull the team dubbed the specimen the monster such pliosaurs are known from remains in countries including the uk and argentina but no complete skeleton has been found hurum says the skull of the pliosaur perhaps a distant relative to scotlands mythical loch ness monster is among the biggest on record scientists will return next year to try to excavate the entire fossil buried on a hillside plesiosaurs which swam with two sets of flippers often preyed on smaller dolphinlike ichthyosaurs all went extinct when the dinosaurs vanished million years ago the scientists rate the fossil graveyard one of the most important new sites for marine reptiles to have been discovered in the last several decades it is rare to find so many fossils in the same place carcasses are food for other animals and usually get torn apart hurum says he thinks the reptiles did not die at the same time in some jurassicera cataclysm but died over thousands of years in the same area they then become preserved in what was apparently a deep layer of black mud on the seabed at that time the area of spitsbergen was under water several hundred kilometres further south around the latitude of anchorage or oslo hurum says the presence of fossils is also an interesting pointer for geologists hunting for oil and gas deposits in the barents sea to the east a skull we found even smells of petrol he says a healthy start to the day the way your breakfast cereal is processed may mean you cant properly extract nutrients from it the same chemical process that makes breakfast cereal tasty can also make it less nutritious according to a recent study as a result puffs contain less nutritionally available protein than flakes researchers report in the journal food chemistry the difference is in the cooking technique the spanish study suggests in the future the researchers say their findings may lead to healthier preparation methods for cold cereals and other processed foods dr francisco morales who led the research says that a chemical process called the maillard reaction affects both flavour and nutrition in cereals in the reaction which is usually induced by heat sugars and amino acids interact to produce odour and flavour molecules its what gives many foods their characteristic toasty golden brown qualities but it also reduces bioavailability of nutrients and it can lead to the formation of contaminants says morales a scientist at the instituto del friacuteo in madrid he and his colleagues studied packaged cold cereals measuring the amount of a chemical produced during the maillard reaction furosine more furosine means less nutritionally available protein the researchers found no significant differences among wheat rice and cornbased cereals but flaked cereals tended to have less furosine than puffed varieties the manufacturing process for flakes and puffs is similar boiling ingredients followed by drying and toasting but puffs need to be cooked at higher temperatures to get their characteristic airy texture the higher temperatures fuel a stronger maillard reaction surprisingly cereals with added dietary fibre had the highest furosine levels just a sprinkle a separate paper published in the same journal hints at a way consumers might compensate if their favourite cereal leaves something to be desired nutritionally a sprinkle of cinnamon might not improve its protein content but it might raise its antioxidant levels antioxidants help the body rid itself of free radicals which can damage cells prior studies have linked free radicals to heart disease cancer and other health problems lucy yu a professor of nutrition and food science at the university of maryland and colleagues looked at the antioxidant properties of several spices and flavourings cinnamon ranked first in antioxidant strength among the tested flavourings rong tsao one of yus research assistants says our findings could potentially be used for dietary supplement developers to help determine what spices and herbs could be used in their products for improved antioxidant properties you can make music just by flexing your fingers in the air musicians can jam together by making gestures with their fingers in the air says an australian researcher dr alistair riddell at the australian national university has developed a system that allows groups of people to make music with a sensor system that translates finger movement into sound its a form of wearable instrument says riddell who will help facilitate a workshop on wearable technology in canberra next year called reskin riddell has already given performances with other musicians using the system it was a very strange kind of performance because people just looked at you and you were moving your hands in front of them and just basically staring at them he says each musician has flexible sensors strapped to both thumbs and six of their fingers as the sensors bend this changes their electrical resistance which in turn communicates changes in sound properties such as the type of sound its pitch volume and effect such as echo each finger involved has between and different positions that corresponded to different parameters riddell says signals are sent to a microcontroller on the musicians back and then on to other computers that build the composition and create the sounds while the idea of creating sound with gesture has been explored previously riddells system is the first to enable more than one person to be involved we shared the same computational space he says of the peformances it wasnt like we were three musicians with three guitars we were actually three musicians with one guitar during the performance riddell hid the technology to maximise dramatic potential what you really saw were three people standing in front of you with their hands raised in front of them and they were bending their fingers he says and at the end of the performance the group extended their fingers brought their arms down by their side and the music stopped challenges riddell says one of the challenges was attaching the sensors and microcontrollers to the musicians its really tricky to put any type of technology close to the skin he says there seems to be some incongruity between technology and our biological wrapping in the end he had special jackets made up to carry the equipment riddell describes performing with the hand sensor system as enjoyable but very exposing sometimes embarrassing and surprisingly physically demanding after minutes or so your hands would really get very sore he says one of riddells collaborators sound and media artist somaya langley is now working on a similar system that uses accelerometers instead of flex sensors attached to arms instead of fingers as you move your arms in space their acceleration in time and space is measured this is linked to sounds produced by a computer that are played through a quadraphonic sound system she says the aim is to be able to throw your arms around in space and be seen to be throwing around a sound its kind of like having a virtual soundobject like a beach ball she says the camel an ancestor of the dromedary was four metres tall and roamed the middle east thousands of years earlier than anyone expected remains of a yearold giant camel new to science have been found in the syrian desert scientists say it was not known that the dromedary was present in the middle east more than years ago says swiss researcher professor jeanmarie le tensorer of the university of basel can you imagine the camels shoulders stood three metres high and it was around four metres tall as big as a giraffe or an elephant he says that makes the ancient camel twice as tall as todays dromedaries or onehumped camels nobody knew that such a species had existed he says tensorer who has been excavating at the desert site in kowm since says the first large bones were found some years ago but they were only confirmed as belonging to a camel after more bones from several parts of the same animal were recently discovered we found the first traces of a big animal in but we were not sure it was a giant camel he says the scientists also found yearold human remains nearby humans apparently killed the camel while it was drinking from a spring says tensorer neanderthal or homo sapiens the bone is that of a homo sapiens or modern man but the tooth is extremely archaic similar to that of a neanderthal we dont know yet what it is exactly do we have a very old homo sapiens or a neanderthal says tensorer we expect to find more bones that would help determine what kind of man it was humans have been present in what is now modern syria for million years the area played a key role in the migration of the first human beings towards asia and europe he says kowm the site where the remains were discovered along with flint and stone weapons is a kilometrewide gap between two mountain ranges that had a number of springs the site was first surveyed in the s and evidence of a millionyearold human settlement has been found there basel university researchers say it is considered a reference for early prehistory in the near east it attracted migrating herds such as antelope and humans archaeological layers covering a period of several hundreds of thousands of years were discovered which is unusual for such an open site tensorer says it was a savannah more or less he says the camels then ate probably what they eat today an active galaxy with a supermassive black hole near its centre spewing out matter across the cosmos our cosmic neighbourhood is flush with supermassive black holes busily devouring nearby stars and other matter say scientists who have unveiled the first complete census of black hole activity in the local universe the survey which took nine months of observations with nasas swift satellite was presented at a recent american astronomical society meeting in san francisco the survey uncovered more than supermassive black holes within million lightyears of earth says dr jack tueller with nasas goddard space flight center these objects also known as active galactic nuclei or agn are millions or even billions times as large as the sun and occupy a region of space about the size of our solar system as they gobble up nearby matter the black holes generate xrays and many other forms of energy other black holes also spew out jets of particles which a related research project has determined are made up of protons and electrons despite their violent activity many agn are obscured by surrounding gas and dust swift a satellite whose main mission is to track gammaray bursts spends its offhours scanning the sky for highpowered xrays this radiation can be detected despite lightabsorbing material that often hides the black holes its hard to believe the whole sky is peppered with black holes says university of maryland researcher dr craig markwardt scientists know that nearly every massive galaxy including our own milky way has a supermassive black hole near its centre but they do not know why only a few percent appear to be actively consuming matter most black holes including our own are dormant and were not surveyed in the swift census but those black holes that are active play a key role in the universe the survey will help scientists understand one of the fundamental processes by which energy is distributed in the universe you cant understand the universe without understanding black holes says dr richard mushotzky also with nasas goddard centre perhaps as much as of all of the radiated energy in the universe arises in one way or another from agn activity highenergy jets another phenomenon of black holes is the jetting of highly energetic particles which are commonly seen radiating from quasars and other objects at nearly the speed of light scientists have long debated whether the long streams which can flow for hundreds of thousands of lightyears across the sky contain electrons their antimatter partners positrons or a mix of electrons and protons new research concludes the streams are made up of protons and electrons the jets are believed to be one of the primary methods for redistributing matter and energy in the universe black hole jets are one of the great paradoxes in astronomy says nasas dr rita sambruna also with goddard how is it that black holes so efficient at pulling matter in can also accelerate matter away at near light speed we still dont know how these jets form but at least we now have a solid idea about what theyre made of south korean protesters burn antinorth korean banners at a rally in seoul on october denouncing north koreas reported nuclear test scientists are taking a waitandsee attitude after north korea said it had successfully conducted a nuclear test only careful analysis of data returned by seismic or atmospheric sensors will say whether the blast was a success or a damp squib they say nor could they rule out the possibility of a scam in which north korea blew up a huge stock of conventional explosives to bolster its claim to have joined the nuclear club james acton of vertic an independent nongovernmental organisation in london that specialises in verification research notes enormous discrepancies in the estimated size of the blast the korea earthquake research centre in south korea says there was a magnitude tremor from north koreas north hamgyong province that translated into the equivalent of tonnes of tnt but russian defence minister sergei ivanov quoted by the itartass news agency says the strength was kilotonnes by comparison the us atomic bomb that destroyed hiroshima during world war ii released the equivalent of about tonnes of tnt ive heard from three different sources that the north korean blast was less than one kilotonne says acton a nuclear physicist by training this russian figure is not a difference of in the yield its huge we should wait to see if that russian statement is confirmed he says acton says that going for a kilotonne yield was the natural size for a country trying to test a nuclear weapon paradoxically it is easier to make and test a hiroshimasized weapon of this size rather than to make a smaller one which requires mastery of miniaturisation techniques if it turns out to be less than a kilotonne it could look very much like a fizzle a bomb that failed to detonate properly and achieve a full chain reaction acton says could it be a fake another theoretical possibility is that north korea stashed lots of tnt underground and blew it up it is possible to tell the difference between a conventional explosion and a nuclear test says acton the differences are very fine and subtle and you need time to analyse the signatures bruno seignier in charge of the analysis and monitoring department at frances atomic energy commission says a nuclear explosion has a more instant shockwave than a chemical one he says that in a small seismic event picking out such differences would take time the analysis is complicated because the energy that radiates out is weak compared with the subterranean background noise picked up by detectors you really have to make a very detailed analysis when you look into such an event to stage a hoax as for the scenario of a hoax acton cautions that to detonate a huge quantity of tnt to simulate a nuclear blast is in itself quite difficult it would entail digging a large cavity underground which would be visible to spy satellites and requires detonators to be triggered at the same time in addition to seismic sensors run by national governments the uns comprehensive nucleartestban treaty organization in vienna also has a network of seismic and hydroacoustic monitoring stations designed to detect nuclear tests the body is not qualified to make public statements on the nature of the incidents registered by its monitoring systems and therefore has not confirmed whether or not a nuclear explosion had taken place as claimed by north korea but the raw data has been passed on to the organisations member states and to institutions around the world telltale signs radioactive particles and gases that can vent from an underground nuclear blast are also telltale signs providing clues as to the type of material uranium or plutonium that was used and to the size of the weapon sniffer planes and ground sensors can be used to monitor this airborne evidence in the case of a totally sealed site nothing may emerge though a third monitoring technique is to use satellites with groundscanning radars which record the topography of a test site before and after an event movement or subsidence of the soil would be the sign of a big blast while the rodent study appears to be successful many safety tests would be needed before the liquid is used on humans having surgery biodegradable liquids that control bleeding during surgery could dramatically reduce time in the operating theatre a study says researchers at the massachusetts institute of technology mit and the university of hong kong have developed a liquid composed of small protein fragments that can stop bleeding in wounded rodents within seconds the researchers say this is the first time that nanotechnology technology at the atomic or molecular scale has been used to achieve complete haemostasis the process of stopping bleeding from a damaged blood vessel they say that if this success could be repeated in humans doctors could have a new tool to combat bleeding one of the hardest problems in surgery the time to perform an operation could potentially be reduced by up to says lead author dr rutledge ellisbehnke a research scientist at mit the findings are reported in the journal nanomedicine the research shows that when a liquid composed of peptides is applied to open wounds the peptides assemble into a nanoscale protective barrier gel that seals the wound and halts bleeding once the injury heals the gel is broken down into molecules that cells can use as building blocks for tissue repair doctors currently have few effective methods to stop bleeding without causing other damage current tools include clamps pressure cauterisation and sponges in their experiments on hamsters and rats the researchers applied the liquid to wounds in various types of tissue including the brain liver skin spinal cord and intestine in almost every one of the cases we were able to immediately stop the bleeding ellisbehnke says the researchers do not know exactly how the solution works but they suspect that the peptides interact with the extracellular matrix around the cells rather than inducing clotting they say the bleeding stopped too quickly for clotting to be the cause and there were no signs of clotting including aggregation of platelets the milky way is about one and a half times more massive than andromeda pictured here the milky way may be the most massive galaxy in the local group and not andromeda according to research that overturns decades of thinking university of cambridge astronomer dr mark wilkinson and colleagues looked at several small dwarf galaxies in the local group which includes andromeda the milky way and dozens of smaller galaxies when they estimated andromedas mass they found it less than previously thought making the milky way the heftiest astronomers determine the mass of galaxies by looking at how fast the stars and the gas in the inner disk are rotating the faster they move the more massive the galaxy until now precise measurements of the rotation of the galaxys dark halo which extends for thousands of lightyears beyond the galaxys visible starry disk have not been possible because there are few visible objects that can be measured but with the high resolution of the european southern observatorys very large telescope wilkinson measured the velocities of stars in several extremely faint dwarf galaxies orbiting andromeda to determine the mass of its dark halo although andromedas inner disk is moving faster than the milky ways further out in the halo which is almost exclusively made up of dark matter the opposite is true he says the best fit for the data showed that the milky way is about one and a half times more massive than andromeda wilkinson and colleagues posted their findings recently on the arxiv physics website and have submitted the data to the journal nuclear physics b largest but not heaviest last year astronomers suggested that andromeda might be three times larger than previously thought but the results are not necessarily contradictory data from the wm keck observatory in hawaii was used to indicate the extent of the visible disk rather than the mass of the whole galaxy we need more data to work out the point at which the mass starts falling off says wilkinson that could tell us more about the profile of dark matter however this latest research is a very small sample only two out of billions of galaxies so we need to reduce the error bars australian researcher dr jeremy bailin from swinburne university of technology agrees its notoriously difficult to measure the mass of astronomical objects you cant put a galaxy on a scale he says but reducing the uncertainties on mass is important for understanding the history of the local group and will help us better understand how it compares with other groups of galaxies a component of the micro gasturbine engine a tiny gasturbine engine that fits on a cent piece could replace batteries that power laptops mobile phones radios and perhaps home generators its developers say the microengine is being developed by a team led by alan epstein a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the massachusetts institute of technology he says the engine could provide five times as much power as a laptop battery for the same cost my laptop battery now runs my computer for about three hours before recharging a microengine power system engine plus fuel with the same weight as the battery should run the laptop for to hours before refuelling says epstein the engine works on the same principle as a jet engine a compressor sucks in air from the outside and compresses the air fuel injectors add fuel to the compressed air and the mixture gets ignited epsteins engine will run on a variety of fuel including kerosene propane ethanol methanol or hydrogen the hot gas produced expands rapidly to turn a turbine which turns a coil inside a magnet to generate electricity a jet engine has thousands of parts assembled into the few components that comprise the compressor combustion chamber and turbine epsteins microengine only has two parts a moveable rotor and a stationary structure that together function as the compressor and combustor and this jet engine would fit into a matchbox the compression chamber is about the size of a pencil eraser the fuel injectors are penpoint holes and the turbine is about the size of a cent piece manufacturing on a small scale such teeny components require a much different manufacturing process than largescale jet engine parts epstein and his team like other researchers in this field turn to the field of microelectromechanical systems or mems which is used to fabricate miniature devices ranging from computer chips and biological sensors to chemical processors they etch out the parts from wafers of silicon the etching requires incredible accuracy with little or no room for error they are bringing the field of mems to levels that a few years ago would have seemed impossible says carlos fernandezpello a professor of mechanical engineering at the university of california berkeley like a car engine pellos team is working on a similar micro system that works like a car engine a bigger challenge for epstein may be getting the individual components to work as a single engine says pello at that tiny scale the heat produced can spread across the whole device causing parts to expand and not work well but if they can find a way to insulate the combustor from the other components a final working product would be about the size of a cigarette lighter with the engine on top and the fuel below the size of that cigarette lighter is the size of two aa batteries but the time it would give you power its potentially times more maybe or hours says pello such a microengine would be as safe as a pocket lighter too he says how about emissions epstein says that his microengine will produce onehundredth the emissions that a rechargeable laptop battery produces indirectly during the recharging stage as it draws electricity from the grid so far the microengineered components have been micromachined tested individually and assembled into the cent piecesized test engines now the team has to add fuel and demonstrate a working engine something epstein thinks can be accomplished within the next months scientists have used computers to analyse how shakespeare used certain words and phrases and have come up with a unique linguistic signature a computational fingerprint that uniquely characterises william shakespeares writing style is helping to dispel any lingering doubts that he penned his own plays the method could analyse not only plays attributed to shakespeare but anonymous or controversial writings by other authors people will take these programs and use the design to go to the th century and talk about lord byron says professor arthur kinney director of the massachusetts center for renaissance studies at the university of massachusetts amherst kinney leads the research with australias professor hugh craig director of the centre for literary and linguistic computing at the university of newcastle the researchers built a massive database containing tens of thousands of words from shakespeares works as well the works of other playwrights of his time then they used a method called computational stylistics to analyse the usage occurrence spelling and placement of phrases as well as common and rare words for example the word gentle appears almost twice as frequently in works by shakespeare than in works by other writers and shakespearean drama frequently finds the word farewell preceded by hail a computational fingerprint is created from known works and then compared with the fingerprints of unknown works to see if there is a match doubts controversy over whether shakespeare an ordinary working class man from the countryside could have authored such remarkable writing began percolating in the middle of the th century those who doubt his ability suggest that another more educated man such as the earl of oxford edward devere penned the plays why would the earl attribute them to shakespeare to deflect criticism some claim during the early part of the s the gathering of a large crowd at a theatre signalled political unrest and made government officials nervous and christian groups such as the puritans found the theatre immoral but there has been plenty of evidence to suggest that shakespeare did write the plays for one shakespeare apparently wrote plays until the earl of oxford died in also at least four different publishers put shakespeares dramas to print if he had not been the author they would have all had to keep the secret the more people you had to have involved in the conspiracy the more likely it would have been that somebody would have blown the whistle says professor gary taylor director of history of text technologies at florida state university kinney and craigs computational method adds scientific credence to the mix the more different kinds of data you have pointing to the same conclusion the more confidence you have in that conclusion says taylor the team is writing a book by me william shakespeare which will be available in late and will contain their findings fusion reactors rely on plasma the gas produced by very high temperatures or pressures such as in the heart of the sun or in lightning australia is running out of time to be part of the global research effort on nuclear fusion say experts dr matthew hole of the australian national university says australia should be a partner in the international thermonuclear experimental reactor iter in southern france which is a testbed for a commercial fusion power reactor the iter project itself is the world largest science experiment says hole a plasma physicist who is chairing a workshop on fusion and the iter in sydney this week hole says iter is driving the international agenda in fusion energy research and australia should be involved so that it keeps its research capacity in the area and does not end up having to buy the technology back at great cost he says the seven iter partners could ratify the final reactor plan as early as december and once these plans are signed off on australia will be locked out of any opportunity to contribute to the reactor construction its a very urgent issue says hole the deadline if not missed is approaching being missed the next opportunity will might be in years time by which time australia will have no research capability in this area an australian discovery fusion power reactors have been a dream of many since australian sir mark oliphant discovered nuclear fusion the process that powers the sun and other stars in fusion involves the release of energy from the combination of two light atomic nuclei typically isotopes of hydrogen and it is this energy that scientists hope to harness as a safe greenhousefriendly and economic form of power hole says nuclear fusion would produce energy at a cost comparable to nuclear fission but with an environmental impact comparable to wind power but there are many challenges significant energy is required to force two positively charged atomic nuclei together and a plasma gas of the charged particles must be kept hot and dense for long enough to undergo fusion one challenge is how to confine the plasma that must be kept at temperatures around the heat of the sun doughnutshaped magnetic fields the iter will be a fusion reactor called a tokomak originally designed in russia but pioneered in the west by australia the tokomak fuses ions of hydrogen deuterium and tritium that are confined in a doughnutshaped magnetic field at temperatures of up to c hole says that unlike previous plasma physics experiments the iter will produce more energy than it consumes under special conditions it will even produce times more energy than it consumes he says various technologies being developed in australia could contribute to the iter but despite australias early leadership in fusion science it now risks missing out unless it is officially part of the frenchbased project hole says relevant australian expertise includes the ability to diagnose what is going on in the reactor including measuring temperatures measuring temperatures at million degrees for example is no simple exercise he says australia also has expertise in developing materials that can handle the high temperatures involved says hole currently hole says only a million is spent on fusion research in australia and this should be increased to a million to be competitive with the us and uk commitment concerns but energy commentator dr mark diesendorf of the sustainability centre in sydney is concerned that the government could invest in fusion at the expense of other lowgreenhouse energy sources that are likely to deliver more quickly diesendorf says while there could be a big payoff from fusion the technology is very risky with the chance of plasma becoming more unstable the more energy you try to get out of the system antinorth korea protesters chant slogans at a protest denouncing both the norths nuclear device test which scientists now say looks like a dud more than two days after north korea claimed to have exploded a nuclear weapon scientists edged towards the conclusion that the test if indeed nuclear was a failure but a failure is unlikely to derail north koreas nuclear program and could even help pyongyangs bomb makers they warn two main sources of scientific evidence are needed to confirm that a blast is nuclear one is the shockwave sent back by ground detectors the other is fallout radioactive particles or gases that often escape from an underground test site even if the tunnel or shaft is sealed tight but north koreas blast was so tiny that the seismic wave is almost indistinguishable from routine subterranean background noise experts say that means it will take a long time harnessing supercomputers and the minds of top physicists to find any telltale spikes that confirm the blast was nuclear and not say a stockpile of tnt blown up as a hoax there is a series of differentiations to be done to sift out the blast from background noise says xavier clement for frances atomic energy commission it is possible that this cannot be done given the weakness of the signals compared to the background noise he says in the absence so far of any known radiological evidence scientists also note the very small size of north koreas explosion only russia has described the blast as a fullfledged nuclear event equivalent to kilotonnes of tnt meanwhile the norwegian institute of seismology norsar describes it as a mediumsized bomb at kilotonnes but other national monitors put it at less than kilotonne with one figure as little as tonnes such low yields are feasible with a nuclear warhead but they are traditionally reserved for established members of the nuclear club that have mastered arts of miniaturisation the easiest size of weapon to build is kilotonnes its harder to build one thats smaller and its harder to build one thats larger says james acton of vertic an independent uk watchdog that carries out research into the verification of international treaties it seems to me technically unlikely and politically unlikely that north korea would have tried to do anything other in its first test than in the kilotonne range says acton a cambridgeeducated nuclear physicist if it was a nuclear test and the yield was less than a kilotonne it seems to me the evidence is that this test was a fizzle it was a partially unsuccessful test clement agrees if it turns out to have been a nuclear test its clear that the weakness of the energy release corresponds to an explosion that fell short of what could have been expected he says if the test failed what went wrong the assumption among experts is that north korea used plutonium rather than uranium to make its bomb given the plutoniummaking reactor and fuel rods known to be in its possession uranium bombs like little boy dropped on hiroshima in are bombs that are relatively easy to make in which a uranium slug is fired into a ball of uranium to achieve critical mass but plutonium bombs are more complicated they entail a small ball of plutonium that like the centre of an onion is swathed by conventional explosives these explosives compress the plutonium and fire a neutron into the mass to initiate a chain reaction but the explosives must be very very carefully shaped and the detonation must be precisely timed to ensure that the neutron is fired at the right time says acton another possibility again still in the realm of hypothesis is that the material used in the test had impurities of plutonium isotopes that emit neutrons and this caused the chain reaction to start prematurely whatever happened none of the problems are in any way terminally fatal to the program cautions acton they will almost certainly have gained information from this test which will have enabled them to build a better weapon next time around the way the earth wobbles on its axis like a poorly balanced spinning top influences our climate and therefore species survival climate change naturally induced by tiny shifts in earths rotational axis and orbit periodically wipes out species of mammals a study says palaeontologists have long puzzled over fossil records that remarkably suggest mammal species tend to last around two and a half million years before becoming extinct climate experts and biologists led by jan van dam at the university of utrecht in the netherlands overlaid a picture of species emergence and extinction with changes that occur in earths orbit and axis the earths orbit is not a perfect circle it is slightly elliptical and the ellipticality itself goes through cycles of change that span roughly and years its axis likewise is not perfectly perpendicular but has a slight wobble rather like a poorlybalanced childs top which goes through cycles of years in addition the axis as schoolbooks tell us is also tilted and this tilt also varies in a cycle of years these three shifts in earths pattern of movement are relatively minor compared with those of other planets but they can greatly influence the amount of heat and light the earth receives from the sun the effect can be amplified causing global cooling affecting precipitation patterns and even creating ice ages in higher latitudes when two or all the cycles peak together van dams team looked at species of mammal fossils recovered from three sites in spain in layers of soil that dated from million years ago to million years ago what the researchers looked for were the fossilised teeth of rodents mainly because these could be spotted and identified much quicker than the remains of other animals they found that rodent species bit the dust in two regular waves one wave of extinction was roughly every million years or so and the other was about every million years or so coinciding with extremes in the cycles of ellipticality wobble and tilt these were not swift massive dieouts of the kind that famously wiped out the dinosaurs million years ago but rather a fadeout of species that could not cope with habitat loss or competition especially when ice ages kicked in as they became extinct other species emerged at any given time there would be around rodent species in residence says van dam during the extinction waves about five or six species would disappear over a period of about years or so the paper which appears today in the journal nature is confident that the species turnover among rodents also happened to other mammals and possibly other biological groups too astronomical impact provides a crucial missing piece in the puzzle of regular species turnover it says charles dickens wasnt a doctor but he learned from them and they learned from him charles dickens was so good at describing neurological disease in his characters that the symptoms were used wordforword in medical text books of the day says an australian neurologist the th century novelists interpretations of diseases of the nervous system even predated formal medical classification some by more than a century in a paper to be published in the journal of clinical neuroscience dr kerrie schoffer of the austin hospital in melbourne says his observations have helped develop our modern understanding of neurological disorders in dickenss day they didnt really understand much about these disorders things like tourette syndrome there was no name for that and no understanding of the biological basis of it she says yet dickens described details in his novel david copperfield his description of the tics teeth grinding and grimaces of the character mr bell now known as symptoms of tourette syndrome was published more than years before gilles de la tourette clinically described the disorder in in the pickwick papers schoffer notes that dickens links parkinsons disease and dementia in an old man whose limbs were shaking with disease and the palsy had fastened on his mind restless legs syndrome a disorder characterised by the compelling need to move the legs schoffer observes is strongly suggested in the sleepy waiter in david copperfield he had the fidgets in his legs and was twisting them and hitting them and putting them through all kinds of contortions in his small pantry schoffer says dickens also had a keen eye for people unsteady on their feet with involuntary muscle movement tremors and sleep problems dickens had little formal education let alone clinical training but schoffer says he had access to people with movement disorders through leading physicians of the day dickenss rise to prominence as an author meant he interacted with high society which tended to be prominent physicians schoffer says if theres one thing that doctors and writers have in common it is that we both have to observe people very closely i think dickenss work is a great model for the interaction between medicine and literature fiddler crabs with blue shells are vulnerable so when hungry birds are around they turn muddy brown tiny blueshelled fiddler crabs change their colour to avoid being eaten by predatory birds researchers have discovered scientists have long been intrigued by the crabs ability to change the colour of their top shell from bright blue to a more subdued muddy shade but exactly why the crabs change their colour hasnt been clear when you catch them for instance they go dull says dr jochen zeil from the australian national university whose research appears in the journal of experimental biology to find an answer zeil and his colleagues studied a particular species of fiddler crab uca vomeris on the mud flats of australias northeast coast south of townsville some populations of these crabs are all very dull but in other places they are very colourful zeil says we wanted to understand how this happens the scientists looked at variations between crabs from three different areas one group was dull coloured another was colourful and a third group mixed they found differences in the numbers of crabeating birds near the dull coloured populations in the places where the crabs were colourful there were few birds zeil says but in the others there were more birds actively hunting crabs to confirm these findings the scientists set up an experimental model to test whether the crabs changed their shell colour in direct response to the threat of being eaten they found two very colourful crabs living close together and set up a kind of wooden screen between them one crab was left to go about its life as normal but the other was subjected every couple of minutes to the attentions of a pretend bird in reality it was a small foam ball suspended on fishing wire crabs have poor vision so the approach of the black ball was enough to convince it a bird was coming zeil says within days that crab had changed its colour to the muddy shade while the other remained colourful we could observe that over a couple of days the crabs did change their colour when they are confronted with this dummy bird the researcher says scientists suspect the blue colour of the crabs is normally used to help them identify others living close by and avoid fights zeil says the next step in his research will be to see whether staying dull all the time has any effect on neighbourly relations insect brains might be small but theyre inspiring robotics researchers an electrical engineer turned biologist who now spends his time unravelling the workings of insect brains has won one of australias top science prizes professor mandyam v srinivasan of the australian national university has won the prime ministers prize for science for work that has applications in the field of robotic vision for example for autonomous aerial vehicles for over years srinivasan has been designing experiments to work out what information honey bees use to take off land on flowers swaying in the breeze navigate the world without bumping into things and find targets if we can find out what the neural circuits underlying those things are maybe we can build machines that are much more cognitive he says srinivasan says insect eyes are too close together to allow them to use stereovision to work out how far away objects are instead he says they rely on measuring how fast objects are moving relative to their eye to work out how far away they are it is this relatively simple strategy says srinivasan that can be reproduced in robotic vehicles so far aspects of his work have been used to develop autonomous aircraft that can track terrain and keep level as they are flying the research has also helped develop wheeled robots that can navigate down narrow corridors and a panoramic imaging and surveillance system which like an insect eye can capture almost the entire environment around it angry bees srinivasan says that over the next five years he wants to shift his focus to studying how angry honeybees that are defending their hive rapidly track down moving targets to sting them we find it a fascinating example of an exquisitely honed system to chase and intercept moving targets he says he will use highspeed video cameras to track in d how angry bees approach and intercept their target srinivasan hopes the information on bees visual cues will help him develop an experiment in which one model aircraft can detect track and intercept another about half of srinivasans funding comes from the australian research council and half from military sources including the us defense advanced research projects agency other prizes another prize goes to csirobased astronomer dr naomi mccluregriffiths who wins the malcolm mcintosh prize for physical scientist of the year mccluregriffiths has been studying the shape of the milky way and has discovered a new spiral arm changing many longheld ideas about the evolution of our galaxy the science ministers prize for life scientist of the year goes to dr james whisstock of monash university for his investigation of serpins which control the break down of damaged cells by proteases anna davis of casimir catholic college in sydney and marjorie colville of perth primary school near launceston win prizes for excellence in science teaching siberian lakes with peatlands massive peat bogs in siberia and elsewhere may have helped spur global warming at the end of the last ice age some years ago scientists report the ice was already melting when the bogs formed but the fact that they emitted the greenhouse gas methane accelerated the warming trend says professor glen macdonald a climate change expert at the university of california los angeles but this does not take humans off the hook given that the amount of methane sent into the atmosphere since the start of the industrial revolution is far higher than what occurred naturally from decomposing material in the old bogs he says the amount of methane that we have added to the atmosphere is even more extreme than the rate of this change that happened at end of the last ice age says macdonald the lead author of a study published today in the journal science over the last years we have more than doubled the amount of methane in the air at the close of the last ice age some years ago the bogs really turned on says macdonald whose collaborators included those from the russian academy of sciences the bogs caused a rise in the atmospheres methane level from to parts per billion by volume but from the year until the present he says methane levels went from to parts per billion how much is down to humans about of the methane going into the atmosphere is anthropogenic or humancaused macdonald says natural sources today arent really capable of producing the spike that were seeing methane has reached levels that are unprecedented methane occurs widely in nature when bacteria help decompose plant and animal material without the benefit of oxygen this happens in big bogs which are made up of a thick layer of incompletely rotted dead organic matter beneath a layer of living vegetation by taking core samples of peat bogs in siberia and adding that data to samples of other peat bogs the scientists determined that these peatlands formed a bit before the end of the last ice age but really grew explosively as it ended methane is said to be up to times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide so knowing a potential source of methane is important the researchers say dragonflies were as large as seagulls million years ago just before the dinosaurs came on the scene the enormous dragonflies millipedes and other insects that lived million years ago grew so large because of earths rich oxygen supply at the time according to a new study why isnt there a cockroach that ate dallas from recent history asks coauthor professor jon harrison of arizona state university we can answer that question without a time machine harrison and his team analysed how modern insects are designed for the fact that air today is oxygen they focused on the tracheal system the interconnected tubes that transport oxygen throughout bug bodies by extension the researchers envisioned what insects would have looked like millions of years ago when the air was oxygen their findings help to explain the remains of millipedes over a metre long centimetre cockroaches and dragonflies with centimetre wingspans dating to the late palaeozoic period just before dinosaurs came on the scene using xray imaging the scientists compared the tracheal dimensions of four modern beetles ranging in size from millimetres to centimetres they found that the tracheal system took up more of the insects body in larger beetles in other words the bigger an insect the more it must invest in air tubing and more tracheae mean less space for everything else in the body such as the brain and reproductive system harrison explains in the oxygenrich world of the palaeozoic era insects needed less air to meet their oxygen needs as a result they could afford smaller trachea than modern insects the researchers conclude that although palaeozoic insects had the same basic body structure as modern insects their maximum body size was larger because smaller trachea left more room for the other essential body parts necessary to sustain their weight the findings were presented at this weeks american physiological society conference in virginia beach dr steve heydon curator and collections manager of the bohart museum of entomology at university of california davis says that the new explanation is plausible but there are other possible explanations for why insects grew smaller such as competition pressure from birds remember that there werent any birds in the sky when the giant insects were out says heydon when flying dinosaurs and birds came around the insects lost their exclusivity what a shocker of a hairdo but would you blurt this out in front of her older people accused of being blunt can blame their deteriorating brain for their straight talking an australian researcher suggests associate professor bill von hippel a psychologist at the university of new south wales says this deterioration means the brain cant properly inhibit older people from saying inappropriate things older adults tend to be more likely to ask about private or personal issues in public than younger adults are says von hippel and we have suggestive evidence that this is brought about by declines in frontal lobe functioning he was recently awarded an australian research council grant to investigate the theory and the implications for older peoples health von hippel says the stereotype is that people over the age of are more likely to speak their mind because they have earned the right to and because they are often seen as a source of wisdom but he says they can lose friends as it can be socially inappropriate if im asking you about your haemorrhoids in public even if i dont mean to be mean by doing it im nevertheless humiliating you and im not providing you with positive emotional support he says and this can be a health issue says von hippel because losing friends can lead to loneliness which is bad for both mental and physical health especially in older people experiments in recent experiments von hippel interviewed people from several groups of older and younger adults about the likelihood that other members of the group were likely to say certain inappropriate things he found that older people were more likely to ask in public if someone had put on weight about their haemorrhoids or whether they were still having problems with their partner he then tested how well the same people inhibited themselves an ability controlled by the frontal lobes by answering trick trivia questions for example they were asked what colour are tigers spots he found that younger people were more likely to restrain themselves from answering the trick question whereas older people were more likely to blurt out black and then realise it was a trick von hippel says evidence from these two experiments shows that the same older people who were more likely to be blunt have lower inhibitory power in their frontal lobes future studies von hippel would now like to do similar tests on a larger number of people using magnetic resonance imaging or mri to check if atrophy in the frontal lobes correlates with bluntness in older adults for now he can not rule out other causes for the bluntness such as early stage dementia but he says the frontal lobe theory is supported by other research showing the people with frontal lobe brain damage are often more socially inappropriate an uncomfortable idea but von hippel says his work has been criticised i think its perceived as an attack on older adults he says i dont believe it is he says it is already accepted that atrophy of the frontal lobes occurs as you age and this affects memory and slows down brain processing what our research is showing is that there are social consequences as well as water falls on the jacket you get a pattern of lights that looks like water falling a coat that glows when it rains has been created by a usbased designer elise co of design and technology firm aeolab in los angeles will be discussing the latest version of her puddlejumper coat at a textiles show in france this month puddlejumper is a luminescent nylon raincoat that turns the prospect of walking in the rain into an opportunity for play and performance says co a former professor of new media its coated with pvc and has water sensors on its back and left sleeve the sensors are wired via interior electronics to electroluminescent panels on the front of the jacket when water hits one of the sensors the corresponding lamp lights up on the front creating a flickering pattern of illumination that mirrors the rhythm of rainfall says co you get a pattern of lights that really looks like water falling she says co says the electroluminescent panels are of the same kind of material used as backlighting for phones the material is usually purchased premanufactured as plastic sheets that are cut up and wired together but co mixed up the chemicals that make the panels and silkscreened them onto the jacket by hand and hand printed the water sensors onto the jacket co will help facilitate a workshop on wearable technology in canberra next year called reskin where she will discuss her work although technology has the bad rap of being dry or technical at the very least intimidating it is great to illuminate how creative a process it is and how doable she says i especially like the mixture of wearable plus technology because clothing and accessories on the body are so expressive and design oriented not only visually but also in terms of materiality and usability and wearability co says her raincoats are still prototypes but the fact they are made of industrial materials mean they could be developed further there is no reason why they couldnt be made durable enough to be worn normally she says it would be a matter of doing tests and tweaking the construction process to make sure theyre protected well caffeine is more likely to disrupt a daytime snooze than a normal nights sleep shiftworkers or people with jet lag who drink coffee to keep themselves awake may not be able to catnap the next day say canadian researchers they report online in the journal neuropsychopharmacology that caffeine has a stronger disruptive effect on daytime catchup sleep after a night of sleep deprivation than it does on a normal nights sleep recent studies have suggested that caffeine is a measure of choice to counteract the effects of sleep deprivation on alertness and performance say dr julie carrier of montreals sacred heart hospital and colleagues our results suggest that this recommendation should be made with caution since using caffeine before sleeping at an abnormal circadian phase such as during night work might have more adverse consequences on sleep quality than before sleeping at a normal circadian time drinking caffeine at night is known to make it more difficult to fall asleep and to worsen sleep quality carrier and her team note they hypothesised that caffeine would have an even stronger effect when people were trying to recover from sleep deprivation by snoozing during the day to investigate they asked people drink caffeine or placebo before going to sleep at their normal bedtime a month later the same people were deprived of sleep for an entire night they were then told to fall asleep an hour after their normal wakeup time after being given placebo or caffeine people received milligrams of caffeine or placebo before their scheduled morning or evening bedtime and then another milligrams or placebo one hour before sleeping after caffeine all study participants who took caffeine took longer to fall asleep and spent more time in lighter stage sleep and less time in deeper stage and slowwave sleep the researchers found but people given caffeine before daytime sleep took even longer to drop off and also slept for a shorter total time and had less rem sleep caffeine didnt affect night time sleep duration or rem carrier and her colleagues suggest that the greater daytime effects of caffeine are due to the fact that people are trying to fall asleep at a time when their body clock is telling them to stay awake even though they are sleepdeprived slowwave sleep is known to last longer during daytime catchup sleep they add which normally helps override this circadian signal given that caffeine reduces slowwave sleep it appears to allow the wakeup call to remain strong the site where this hand and forearm stencil was found is years old fieldwork in whats believed to be one of the most significant rock art sites in australia has stalled after the federal government declined to fund further research archaeologists say over the weekend scientists exploring the wollemi national park northwest of sydney announced the discovery of numerous shelters many with rock drawings and stencils up to years old they also discovered whats believed to be the first hafted stone axe found in southeastern australia estimated to be around years old but now the archaeologists are being forced to look for international funding to continue their work and cant even afford a day trip to the remote area to protect vulnerable sites from damage by bushfires says team coleader professor paul taon of griffith university the largest and most significant site an engraved platform a few kilometres from where the axe was found is at immediate risk taon says the platform features large eagle and koala figures and images of what are believed to be ancestral beings there is a lot of vegetation around the edge of the platform and fallen tree limbs which will provide fuel for bushfires he says if we get a really hot one in the next few months there is a risk that some of the engravings weve discovered wont be there any more ideally it would be good to just go in to clear it up but at the moment we dont have any funding to do anything at all taon says the australian research council informed him last week that his grant application worth several hundred thousand dollars a year over the next five years had been knocked back in favour of international projects the application was for further work in the wollemi and other parts of the country on rock art he says it looks like no rock art projects will be getting up and hardly any australian archaeology projects at all most of the money went for people working on archaeological projects overseas he says the latest trip and previous surveys of the wollemi bushland where the jurassicera wollemi pine was also discovered have been funded by team members and international organisations the researchers are currently talking to a new zealand company for funding to help them return for more surveying in april given what weve found on each trip theres probably lots more out there he says an australian research council spokesperson could not comment on individual funding applications but confirms some applications for international archaeological projects were successful in the last round yes we did fund a number of archaeological projects and several involved research overseas she says but it is all by researchers who reside predominantly in australia the future of the axe meanwhile the future of the axe which still has traces of resin most likely made from plants and beeswax remains up in the air taon says it will either remain undisturbed in the cave where it was found or be moved to the australian museum in sydney for public display perhaps it can remain and eventually turn to dust he says sometimes removing objects destroys the context and connection to the larger landscape and history of a particular area but a final decision about whether the axe should stay or go will be made by local aboriginal groups he says dave pross from the darkinjung local aboriginal land council wants to see the axe in a museum to prevent it being picked up by bushwalkers and ending up on an online auction site like many other aboriginal artefacts hell argue for this at the next land council meeting my view is to get it out and put it into a museum because bushwalkers can come in find something and put it on ebay he says lets put these things in a museum as long as they can be used for a display or showed to students and theyll be safe horned beetles can have big weapons or big testes not both beetles with the biggest horns have the smallest testes say scientists who show that in evolutionary terms you cant have it all they say their finding is clear evidence of an evolutionary tradeoff between the ability to fight off sexual competitors and reproductive potency or put simply the ability to find a mate and the ability to fertilise her professor leigh simmons of the university of western australia and us researcher professor douglas emlen of the university of montana publish their findings online today in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences the researchers looked at beetles of the genus onthophagus dung beetles known for the size and variety of their horns what we did was test a fundamental assumption underlying evolution that males face a tradeoff between competing for access to lots of females and investment in gaining fertilisation with those females simmons says they need to have big horns to win fights and get females and they need to have big testes in order to win in sperm competition but they cant do both so species which invest very heavily in their horns tend to invest less in their testes the study also demonstrates the theory of sperm competition which occurs when females mate with more than one partner simmons says according to this theory male rivalry continues after a mate has been found as sperm from different males compete to fertilise an egg theory predicts that males should increase their investment in sperm production as sperm competition in increased he says manipulating horns simmons tested the theory by cauterising the area of the developing beetle pupa where the horns would grow destroying cells and preventing horn growth he found that if horn development was inhibited the pupa compensated by developing larger testes the principle is known as a resource allocation tradeoff he says they got a fixed amount of resources to allocate to various structures to their legs their wings their horns and to their testes and other important organs he says if the developing beetle doesnt produce horns those males then produce bigger testes because they have resources that werent used for horn growth other examples simmons says the principle of resource allocation has been demonstrated in other animal studies for example there is some evidence that bats trade the size of their testes for brain power and a recent study showed that stalkeyed flies in which eye span width is a measure of sexual desirability trade testes size for the width of their eyes there have been suggestions of a tradeoff between gaining mates and gaining fertilisation but our study is probably one of the most conclusive studies to date to have demonstrated this simmons says the new element travels through the accelerator to the detector scientists say they have discovered a superheavy element known as albeit one that has only lasted a fraction of a second over months of experiments scientists at the lawrence livermore national laboratory in california and russias joint institute for nuclear research in dubna expect the new element to be a noble gas that lies below radon in the periodic table they publish their results in the journal physical review c scientists discovered the last naturally occurring element on the periodic table in but have since tried to create new heavier elements in the latest experiments the scientists bombarded the element californium with calcium ions to create two atoms of element the atoms of element also known as ununoctium lasted milliseconds they say the team then observed the element decay to element then to this makes it the fifth new element for the collaborating scientists and now an announcement in from researchers at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory in california claiming they had found element was later shown to have been a fraud we selected a completely different nuclear reaction performed with completely different people in a different laboratory says dr ken moody the livermore team leader everything we do is checked and double checked the data analysis is performed by both us and our russian colleagues we do everything that we can possibility do to both avoid the possibility of intentional fraud and of mistaken handling of the data the livermoredubna team says its now looking to create element by bombarding plutonium with iron isotopes so it looks like high school and university science labs may still have to replace their periodic table posters yet again one day we might be filling our cars with biodiesel produced using genetically modified organisms genetically modified microorganisms could one day make it easier and cheaper to produce biofuels experts say a symposium convened by the australian institute of agricultural science and technology in canberra this week will hear about future directions in biofuel technology and ways of meeting national biofuel targets speaker leo hyde research and development manager at dupont australia says improving the yeasts and bacteria that turn raw biomass into fuel is a major step in reducing the use of fossil fuels hyde says the company is developing bacteria specifically tailored to the production of butanol like ethanol butanol can be produced from the sugars contained in cellulose waste from crops like corn or sugar cane and even logging waste we have bugs now but theyre not efficient enough he says what were working on is another bug that we believe will be far more efficient than the current process of producing butanol youd reengineer it to make the butanol pathway more efficient well modify pathways how it uses energy to improve the yield of the product you want what are the benefits phillip calais is a renewable energy consultant and former lecturer in environmental science at murdoch university where hes involved in a biofuels project he says there are benefits in using genetically modified or gm bugs in the fermentation of fuels like butanol which he says is more oillike than ethanol and mixes better with petrol but is more difficult to produce butane is made from a raw product that is then broken down to starch or sugars fermented and purified with butanol fermentation has to be very pure if there are any weird strains of bacteria it really upsets the fermentation process he says the bugs that are currently used are also destroyed once butanol reaches a certain concentration which means more costly and time consuming processing is needed to purify it after fermentation by using gm you can actually breed up different bugs that can survive a higher concentration of purity in the butanol calais says if you can make it more concentrated in the first place by using better bugs you can do less processing later what about the risks the use of gm organisms holds promise for certain niches says adrian lake founder and president of the biodiesel association of australia but he says the technology is still being developed and has potential risks theres potential danger in changing any bugs he says if its an organism thats extremely aggressive and has to be highly controlled because it will replicate and damage other organisms thats a concern fred the thread a caterpillar that lives in the stem of a new zealand wetland plant fred the thread is vying for a place in the record books as the worlds thinnest caterpillar its discoverers say the new zealand caterpillar is barely millimetres wide and is the larval stage of an entirely new genus and species of moth houdinia flexilissima but scientists at landcare research who discovered fred are concerned about his survival this is because he lives in the cane rush sporadanthus ferrugineus a threatened wetland plant that forms peat the researchers publish details of fred in the latest issue of the journal invertebrate systematics invertebrate ecologist dr corinne watts was researching the restoration of areas mined for peat at torehape on new zealands north island and she was intrigued by starshaped tunnels in the plant stems it was obvious that something was making them but every time i cut open a stem there was nothing inside she says at the time the caterpillars were so tiny that i kept missing them it wasnt until they grew bigger that i finally saw a bright orange thread and thought gotcha taxonomist dr robert hoare used an electron microscope to measure the caterpillar which although thin grows to a respectable few centimetres long sporadanthus stems are very narrow so to live inside them the caterpillar has to get longer rather than fatter says watts finding the tiny adult moths only half a centimetre long proved almost as difficult that was until using a technique borne of frustration the scientists learnt that kicking the plants elicited a cloud of them the moths are active at dusk and survive for a brief breeding period of four to six weeks between october and november although the entire life cycle is not yet fully understood it is clear that over two or three years the caterpillar goes through the usual stages of moulting pupating and metamorphosing into a most unusual moth all within the confines of a millimetre wide stem such a feat as well as the remarkable way the species has managed to elude detection for so long prompted the new genus to be named after the renowned escapologist harry houdini fred the threads host plant is found in one of three remaining peat bogs on the north island the researchers say over the years drainage and conversion of peat bogs to pasture has resulted in habitat loss leading for calls to put the plant on the endangered list and to reappraise the conservation status of the moth it could take centuries not decades to melt the dense ice packs that accumulate and creep down the himalayas says a scientist glaciers in the himalayas have not drastically shrunk despite climate change and are unlikely to melt away in coming decades a chinese scientist says professor zhang wenjing glacier expert at the chinese academy of sciences discounted previous forecasts that glaciers across western china could disappear in decades or the himalayan glaciers could melt away in years reports the xinhua news agency those predictions may be excessively pessimistic he says so far glaciers in the middle and eastern part of the himalayas have not shrunk on any large scale zhang does not question climate change but says it would take perhaps centuries to melt the dense ice packs that accumulate and creep down the himalayas the glaciers in the region are melting comparatively slowly says zhang who is taking part in an international expedition to study the mountains zhangs comments appear to clash with the conclusions of many other scientists and conservationists that many parts of the asian mountain chain are likely to experience severe melting as global temperatures rise in coming decades in the past years glaciers across the tibetan plateau that spills from china into south asia have shrunk by square kilometres especially since the s the conservation group wwf says in a report the glaciers now cover about square kilometres it says a report on climate change organised by chinese government agencies says last year that considerable uncertainty surrounds the effects of rising average temperatures on glaciers in different regions but the report forecast that by glaciers in chinas west will have dramatically shrunk scientists have fired lasers at cells to make them vibrate then picked up the characteristic sound of melanoma cells in the blood doctors looking to see if cancer has spread may be able to one day simply listen for it us researchers report researchers at the university of missouricolumbia say they have used a technique called photoacoustic detection to pick up the characteristic vibrations of melanoma cells in the blood they say their method could let oncologists spot as few as cancer cells in a blood sample catching a tumours spread before it can settle into another organ writing in the october issue of the journal optics letters the researchers say they combined laser techniques from the field of optics and ultrasound techniques from acoustics they used a laser to make cells vibrate and then picked up the characteristic sound of melanoma cells the researchers say they were able to detect melanoma cells obtained from actual patients the dark microscopic granules of melanin in the melanoma cancer cells absorb the energy bursts from the blue laser light as the melanoma cells expand and contract they generate crackling sounds that can be picked them up with special microphones and analysed by computer other human cells do not contain pigments with the same colour as melanin so the melanin signature is easy to tell apart from other noises says assistant professor john viator a biomedical engineer who worked on the study the only reason there could be melanin in the human blood is that there would be melanoma cells he says a blood screening test could reassure patients who have a growth removed or tell a doctor to start chemotherapy quickly because the cancer has already started to spread it could take just minutes to find out if there are any circulating cancer cells viator says because of melanin melanoma is the only type of cancer that can be detected in this way but the researchers say they could try using artificial materials to act as light absorbers and as noise makers were looking for methods to attach other kinds of absorbers to cancer cells viator says the fish skull emerging from the rock it was found in fish developed features characteristic of land animals much earlier than once thought say researchers dr john long of museum victoria and colleagues base their conclusions on an uncrushed millionyearold fish fossil found in western australia the specimen is the most perfect complete threedimensional fish of its kind ever discovered in the whole world says long who reports the teams findings online today in the journal nature it looks like it died yesterday you can still open and close the mouth long says the preserved remains of a gogonasus fish from the devonian period were found last year in the remote kimberley area at the gogo fossil site once an ancient barrier reef teeming with fish previous analyses based on limited material suggested gogonasus had relatively primitive features says long but when his team used a ct scanner at the australian national university to analyse this new fossil it found the fish had a number of features common to land animals its hiding a lot of deceptively advanced features that were not recognised before until we had such a perfect specimen says long for example gogonasus had hole in its skull similar to that found in the first land animals he says this hole eventually became the eustachian tube in higher vertebrates says long his teams analysis also revealed the fishs pectoral fin had the same pattern of bones as the forelimbs or arms of land animals called tetrapods its definitely a fish its got gills it swims in water its got fins says long but its a fish that is showing the beginnings of the tetrapods advanced body plan that would eventually carry on to all living land animals gogonasus also had a cheek bone structure similar to early amphibian and a single pair of nostrils like we have says long wolf in sheeps clothing earlier this year scientists reported the discovery of tiktaalik roseae a millionyearold species of fish that filled the evolutionary gap in the transition between water and land animals while tiktaalik had a skull that was identical to an amphibian gogonasus looks much more like a fish says long this particular fish is a bit like a wolf in sheeps clothing he says this image of the lunar south pole together with radar echoes was thought to be evidence for ice now scientists say it isnt ice just rough terrain hopes that the moons south pole has a vast hoard of ice that could be used to establish a lunar colony are sadly unfounded a new study says in radar echoes sent back in an experiment involving a us orbiter called clementine appeared to show a treasure trove of frozen water below craters near the lunar south pole at the time scientists saw this as evidence of ice in areas that were permanently shaded from the sun if so such a find would be an invaluable boost to colonisation as the ice could be used to provide water as well as hydrogen as fuel nasa is looking closely at the south pole as a potential site for the us return mission to the moon scheduled to take place by but a paper published today in the journal nature says the clementine data was most probably misinterpreted professor donald campbell of cornell university and colleagues including dr nicholas stacy from australias defence science and technology organisation collected radar images of the moons south pole to a resolution of metres they looked especially at shackleton crater which had generated most interest the team found that a particular radar signature called the circular polarisation ratio which in the clementine experiment was taken to indicate thick deposits of ice could also be created by echoes from the rough terrain and walls of impact craters the signature was found in both sunny and permanently shady areas of crater which suggests that the reflection comes from rocky debris not thick ice deposits if there is any ice at the south pole it probably comes from tiny scattered grains that probably account for only of the local dust the authors suggest any planning for future exploitation of hydrogen at the moons south pole should be constrained by this low average abundance rather than by the expectation of localised deposits at higher concentrations the paper says the research involved sending a radar signal from the arecibo telescope in puerto rico the signal hit the southern lunar region and the reflection was picked up by the us green bank telescope the latest study on the best time of year to shear sheep overturns years of thinking farmers who want to produce better quality wool dont necessarily need to shear their sheep in autumn australian researchers have found angus campbell a phd student from the university of melbourne and colleagues show that theres no particular shearing season that consistently improves wool strength that finding could have important implications for australias multibillion dollar wool industry for the past years or so many farmers have sheared their sheep in autumn in the hope of getting better quality fibres and a higher price for their wool the idea behind this is that wool gets thinner in summer and then thickens in late autumn campbell says this would make the wool stronger because it would be thin on the end but thicker and stronger in the middle to test this theory campbell and his colleagues designed a study that used real life conditions on two commercial merino farms west of geelong in victoria each year for five years they sheared ewes and lambs in three different seasons and measured the quality of the wool onethird of the sheep were shorn in december onethird in march and another third in may these were three realistic shearing times based on other research and talking to wool growers he says the result the wool strength from those three shearing times was the same campbell says the connection between wool fibre thickness and season has more to do with nutrition than weather the researcher explains in summer the fibres tend to get thinner as the flocks rely more on dried feed while the rains of autumn bring proteinrich green grass which makes the wool quickly get thicker but in spring when many farmers have their sheep bearing lambs a similar thing happens because the ewes devote all their energy into growing the lamb and not into the wool this all means that among ewes and lambs no annual shearing time is going to consistently shear through the weak part of the fibre campbell says in a way the results are good news for farmers he says it means that if a farmer has a really good reason for choosing a shearing time based on something specific to the farm then i reckon they can go ahead and do it and not worry about it harming their wool value he says campbells research will form part of his phd which is to be submitted later this year its how you see things throughout the ages scientists have been quick to judge scientists whose work doesnt fit their view of the world scientists may say they are dispassionate defenders of the unfettered pursuit of truth but history suggests they are often guilty of being irrational and narrowminded says an australian philosopher emeritus professor miles little of the university of sydney argues his case in the current issue of the journal medical humanities science is supposed to be the ultimate in rationality its supposed to be the ultimate in evidence and the assessment of evidence says little a former surgeon now at the universitys centre for values ethics and the law in medicine but science doesnt behave like this in the face of aberrant science aberrant science can involve the use of methods or the arrival at conclusions the majority dont agree with and is often shunned as if it was fraudulent he says and yet says little some aberrant science is by honest hardworking scientists who produce very important results while fraud is clearly an undesirable form of aberrant science little says those whose only crime is to use unusual methods or reach unusual conclusions should not be treated with the same contempt instead he says they should be greeted with openmindedness a feature that is supposed to be the hallmark of good science little says an example of such unfairly treated aberrant science is something that challenges the current scientific paradigm the given set of assumptions about how the world works an example of this is the claim made by immunologist dr jacques benveniste in the late s he said a solution of antibodies so dilute they were unlikely to contain any molecules could activate white blood cells a claim could be used to support the claims of homoeopathy little says the scientific communitys immediate response to what they saw as dysfunctional science was to attack benveniste personally and to vilify and humiliate him the way the judgement was made was not scientific says little while subsequent attempts failed to reproduce benvenistes results little says the outcome of other cases of aberrant science have been eventually accepted one example is professor joseph lister who argued against the wisdom of the th century that pus was a sign of infection by germs which should be prevented from entering wounds the majority of surgeons rejected it out of hand says little lister was seen as a young whippersnapper defying wellestablished tradition flying in the face of authority and it took the next generation of surgeons to accept his views little says a related category of unfairly treated aberrant science is something that challenges the accepted ideology of the day scientists have made an invisibility cloak that works with microwaves but there are many technical challenges before a cloak could work with visible light to make someone invisible scientists say they have found a way to hide an object from microwave radiation in a first step towards making what they hope will be an invisibility cloak the cloaking device is said to deflect microwaves so they flow around a hidden object inside it with little distortion making it seem as if there was almost nothing there such a device could one day be used to elude radar or in wireless communications but the researchers like many scientists are not working with any particular goal in mind but hope its uses will become apparent later its not quite harry potter says professor david smith of duke university in north carolina referring to the childs fictional character who can conceal himself in a magical cloak its not exactly perfect we can do better but it demonstrates the mechanism the way the waves swirl around the centre region where you want to conceal things says smith who publishes the results online today in the journal science building a cloak every solid object scatters radiation that hits it from microwaves through to visible light it is this scattering that allows objects to be seen whether with the eye or using radar or ultrasound the cloaking device manipulates this scattering effect it relies on new laboratorymade materials called metamaterials engineered composite materials whose properties can be manipulated by tweaking their structure for instance metamaterials can decrease both the scattering caused by a solid object and the shadow it casts in this case the cloak is quite thick smith says twice as big as the centimetre copper tube it hides and the materials are arranged in concentric rings in may the same researchers reported their theory and it took them just a few months to demonstrate it the cloak reduces both back scatter or reflection of microwaves and forward scatter or shadows limitations the cloak only works in d but the researchers have already started work on a d version the cloak also only works with microwaves of a specific wavelength and the researchers hope to broaden the range of wavelengths that it can block but making something invisible to the human eye would present a much greater challenge such a cloak would have to simultaneously interact with all the wavelengths that make up light it is very unlikely that we could do it with this technology in the visible spectrum smith says it would have to be scaled down to nanotechnology levels but the metals involved behave differently on that scale he says eluding radar microwave cloaks might be useful for eluding radar says professor costas soukoulis a theorist with the us department of energys ames laboratory in iowa this is very very important that experiments have produced what theorists had predicted soukoulis told science the researchers are funded by the defense advanced research projects agency and the design is based on a theory proposed by professor john pendry of imperial college london brain damage can improve your artistic skills but can also make your paintings less emotional so does everyone have the potential to become the next picasso damage to a particular part of the brain can trigger artistic talent us neurologists show when they looked at one particular artist whose frontal and temporal lobes of the brain had deteriorated they found she had developed new artistic skills the us researchers published their study into the artistic effects of frontotemporal lobar dementia in the latest issue of the journal neurology there have been reports of previously inartistic people becoming talented visual artists after developing this condition but it is not clear whether the brain atrophy is releasing dormant talent or the disease itself has somehow triggered the artistic expression to investigate dr valeria drago of the university of florida at gainesville and others studied the art of a woman who had been an artist before developing this type of brain damage as the womans condition worsened they found her artistic technique improved but the emotional power of her work decreased we can really follow how the paintings have been changed following the disease says drago drago and her team gathered of the womans paintings including several from the period before she developed symptoms some were when her symptoms were beginning and some were painted later the researchers then gave men and women training on how to evaluate six different artistic qualities and asked them to rate the paintings ratings for the paintings artistic skill rose as the womans disease progressed but ratings on the paintings evocative impact and closure fell evocative impact is the ability of a work of art to elicit an emotional reaction while closure is the sense that a painting is finished and complete drago and her team note that the condition leaves the parts of the brain at work in drawing painting and other skills relatively intact the part of the brain the disease does affect may typically inhibit this region of the brain so when it is damaged artistic talents have freer rein they suggest the researchers also point out that patients with this form of brain damage may have damage to the limbic system a network within the brain essential for mediating emotions this damage could in turn impair an artists ability to paint emotionally affecting paintings or to portray emotion visually drago says she and her team are continuing to study creativity and the brain and are currently looking at how normal ageing may change creativity women who believe that men are better at maths do worse in maths tests than women who dont believe the stereotype when women believe they are genetically bad at maths the belief becomes a selffulfilling prophesy research shows the divide between mens and womens talent at maths may therefore be due to misinformation more than genetic destiny a report published in the latest issue of the journal science shows that women exposed to theories saying females are genetically bad at maths perform far worse on maths tests than women who had not been exposed to such beliefs canadian psychologists associate professor steven heine and doctoral student ilan darnimrod from the university of british columbia studied how female students performed in maths tests after reading fake research reports the psychologists had invented the reports which contained bogus claims about men being better at maths one phoney paper claimed to have discovered that the male y chromosome gives men a edge over women in maths another fake paper claimed that men have a edge because maths teachers stereotype girl and boy students at a very young age heine says the research clearly shows that women who read the fake report about genetics did much worse in the maths test the research he says shows that people believe they can overcome stereotyping and continue to try but if they blame their genetic makeup and believe they have an innate lack of ability they give up he says people think genes are at the core of who we are he says but much genetics research is still unproved just raising the question about genes has harmful consequences often says heine science about research on genes affecting gender obesity or homosexuality is grossly simplified in the media the reports themselves have the potential to undermine peoples motivations if i believe that genes have a deterministic influence on my weight will i still struggle to keep up with my diet and exercise routine genetics research is a booming industry and every week scientists are identifying a new gene he says but genes work in complicated ways scientists dont yet understand he warns and not all scientific theories are created equal socalled brain sex genetic differences between mens and womens brains is a controversial research subject its so contentious that earlier this year professor lawrence summers resigned as president of harvard university amid an uproar after he suggested that women have less intrinsic ability in maths and science than men champion racehorse phar lap died more than years ago but a scientific test has sparked fresh debate about what caused his demise melbourne museum claims that champion australian racehorse phar lap was killed by arsenic poisoning are

synchrotron science says there are too many ifs whats and wherefores to declare the case of phar laps unexplained death shut lewis who has seen the results of synchrotron analysis of phar laps hair conducted in the us says the research is preliminary he says its too early to tell whether arsenic detected in the hair is from a chemical used during the taxidermy process to preserve the horse or the results of foul play phar lap the melbourne cup champion and one of australias greatest sporting icons died in shortly after winning americas richest race the agua caliente handicap the exact cause of his death has never been proved although there was speculation it was the work of gangsters so dr ivan kempson a research fellow based at the university of south australia came up with the idea of using a synchrotron to analyse phar laps hair all of our analysis so far indicates that he most probably did consume a dose of arsenic just prior to his death he says kempson says analysis by the advanced photon source synchrotron near chicago shows two forms of arsenic one of them lead arsenide could be associated with preservation he says but the other is more likely to be the result of ingestion the other type of arsenic is consistent by its distribution and location and chemistry with him ingesting the arsenic between hours prior to his death he says weve been going through a process of trying to prove ourselves wrong and look for alternative explanations but so far the results are consistent with him consuming arsenic horse hair samples but lewis says more work is needed to analyse samples from the stuffed horse which is preserved for public display at the melbourne museum nobodys ever actually analysed hair from an animal thats been stuffed for this long he says what you really need to prove this kind of thing is horses that were stuffed and you check all of them and if you find a major problem in one of them you say that ones different but in this case weve got one and given that we dont actually understand exactly what procedure was used to preserve phar lap how do we know whether the stuff was used in the preserving or whether it was given to him beforehand lewis says synchrotrons can closely analyse the structure of chemicals like arsenic the synchrotron without any shadow of a doubt gives you more information than you could have got in other ways but whether or not its conclusive would it stand up in a court of law personally i have my doubts he says there are all sorts of things we dont quite know we dont know the process that was used in tanning the hide we dont know what has happened to the condition of that arsenic in the years since phar lap died things oxidise things change bugs get in all sorts of things change biological materials dont stay the same and clearly that sort of thing might have happened kempson says more research is planned to hopefully finally lay the case to rest including comparison with similar cases so far phar laps sample has only been compared with a stuffed monkey he says what is a synchrotron lewis describes a synchrotron or particle accelerator as essentially a large xray machine that can concentrate a large number of xrays onto a tiny object like a single hair the xrays are produced by particles that are accelerated around a large ring at close to the speed of light as the particles pass magnetic fields in the ring they emit rays approximately a billion times brighter than the sun in this case instead of looking at the xrays that go straight through the hair you look at the xrays that scatter off it and come off in different directions he says those xrays carry information about things like the arsenic and the chemistry of the arsenic no single event like a huge meteor strike is solely responsible for a mass extinction says new research not even the demise of the dinosaurs million years ago if you cant decide if you prefer meteor impacts volcanoes or some other explanation for earths biggest mass extinction events take heart you no longer have to choose a new statistical study of mass extinctions throughout the history of life on earth is backing the idea that no single meteor volcanic eruption or other lone gunman is ever to blame this even applies to the cretaceoustertiary event that brought the end of dinosaurs million years ago the us researchers say instead the worst dieoffs happen when some sort of interminable multigenerational pressure on life is combined with a few powerful blows its what is now being called the presspulse theory of mass extinctions reading the cretaceoustertiary extinction literature and conversations with colleagues made me wonder whether the simplistic scenario of everythings fine until one day in june when the asteroid hits and everything goes to hellinahandbasket really explains the diversity of data says plant fossil expert associate professor nan arens of hobart and william smith colleges in new york wouldnt it make more sense she surmised if certain species were already vulnerable when the triggering event happened to test the idea she and thenundergraduate student ian west compiled a large database of marine organisms and their extinctions through geological time they divvied up the past million years into four groups suspected meteor impacts pulses gigantic volcanic flood basalt eruptions presses periods with neither presses nor pulses and times when press and pulse coincided they then compared average extinction rates in each group flood basalt eruptions are considered presses because they release vast amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and can change the earths climate single or multiple event the researchers found similar extinction rates when a pulse or press occurred by itself and when neither was occurring says arens however when an impact occurred during a time of volcanic flood that produced higher extinction rates arens is presenting her work this week at the annual meeting of the geological society of america in philadelphia the goal of our work was to come up with a unifying theory of mass extinctions says west they also wanted to make the theory applicable to the rapid extinctions now being seen as a result of accelerating climate change press and the ongoing destruction of wild habitats by human activities worldwide pulse the theory is essentially a more eloquent way of saying what i and many other palaeontologists have been saying for many years says professor gerta keller of princeton university namely that the impactkill hypothesis is all wrong impacts alone could not have been the killing mechanism for the kt cretaceoustertiary event or any of the other major mass extinctions volcanic activity in the late cretaceous case massive volcanism the deccan traps eruption in india and attendant climate change coincided with an impact that pushed highly stressed biota over the brink im very happy they have done the analysis based on the literature and come up with the same conclusions that palaeontologists have been preaching all along keller says viruses may be able to cross into the brain causing steady damage over the years forget where you left your glasses did those keys go missing again a virus may be to blame viruses that cause a range of ills from the common cold to polio may be able to infect the brain and cause steady damage a team at the mayo clinic in minnesota reports our study suggests that virusinduced memory loss could accumulate over the lifetime of an individual and eventually lead to clinical cognitive memory deficits says dr charles howe who reports the findings in the latest issue of the journal neurobiology of disease the viruses are called picornaviruses and infect more than billion people worldwide each year they include the virus that causes polio as well as colds and diarrhoea people contract an average of two or three such infections a year we think picornavirus family members cross into the brain and cause a variety of brain injuries for example the polio virus can cause paralysis howe says it can injure the spinal cord and different parts of the brain responsible for motor function in the mouse virus we studied it did the same thing and also injured parts of the brain responsible for memory the researchers infected mice with a virus called theilers murine encephalomyelitis virus which is similar to human poliovirus infected mice later had difficulty learning to navigate a maze some were barely affected while others were completely unable to manage when the mice were killed and their brains examined a correlating amount of damage was seen in the hippocampus region related to learning and memory one virus particularly likely to cause brain damage is enterovirus which is common in asia the researchers say it can cross over into the brain and cause encephalitis a brain inflammation that can lead to coma and death our findings suggest that picornavirus infections throughout the lifetime of an individual may chip away at the cognitive reserve increasing the likelihood of detectable cognitive impairment as the individual ages the researchers write we hypothesise that mild memory and cognitive impairments of unknown aetiology may in fact be due to accumulative loss of hippocampus function caused by repeated infection with common and widespread neurovirulent picornaviruses other viruses kill brain cells including the herpes virus and hiv this mockup illustrates the dangers foxes pose to penguins on phillip island a drug that makes vixens neglect their cubs could help solve australias feral fox problem researchers say they are looking at the drug cabergoline which reduces fertility and interferes with maternal instincts to see if it could control foxes on phillip island in victoria the island is home to a renowned penguin colony and up to unwanted foxes a fox can kill up to penguins a night says dr roger kirkwood a biologist at the phillip island nature park we need to eradicate foxes from the island because just one fox can step in there and do so much damage he says the foxes also feast on migratory mutton birds that visit the island says kirkwood hes working with university of tasmania pharmacologist professor stuart mclean to study cabergoline in humans the drug is used to treat parkinsons disease but the scientists are interested in using the drug in foxes as it acts on the brains dopamine receptors to block secretion of the hormone prolactin foxes rely on prolactin to become pregnant and maintain pregnancy and to lactate and also for their mothering instinct after the cubs are born says mclean because it suppresses maternal instincts cabergoline makes vixens less likely to care for their cubs by bringing them food grooming them and teaching them survival skills which reduces their chances of survival the drug has not yet been tested on foxes on the island but preliminary research will be presented at the australian health and medical research congress next month a study looking at how long cabergoline remains in fox bait has also been submitted to the journal wildlife research toll on penguins kirkwood says if foxes are allowed to breed out of control they could destroy phillip islands strong penguin population foxes have already reduced the number of penguin colonies on phillip island from to just one in the past years more than foxes have been eliminated since the introduction of a control program on the island in which includes shooting poisoning fumigating dens and using dogs to hunt the foxes kirkwood says although foxes only live about five years the population is resilient and recovers quickly if we stopped our program we reckon the carrying capacity of the island would be over foxes and they would eliminate the penguins given time if we didnt control them he says are you a youtube legend be careful your videos dont get you into legal hot water internet law experts have called for australian copyright laws to be amended so people can post online videos of themselves miming pop songs without risking prosecution researcher damien obrien and professor brian fitzgerald of queensland university of technology qut say miming copyright material and posting it online may be currently illegal they will explore copyright law in relation to the popular youtube site in the internet law bulletin the video sharing website youtube hosts more than new videos every day many made by amateurs a year old girl uploads a video of herself lipsyncing the latest shakira pop song onto youtube and is served with a copyright infringement notice they write has she breached copyright law the answer they say is yes certainly many of the videos that are uploaded onto youtube probably infringe copyright if theyre reproductions or communications of the whole or even a little bit of the original obrien says while there have been no prosecutions in australia yet major music companies particularly in the us have been active in demanding that such videos be removed from youtube calls for change he says amendments to australian copyright law currently being considered by parliament fail to take cases like amateur miming into account obrien says some types of reproduction are allowed under fair trading provisions in the amendments but these dont cover cases like the one highlighted in his paper hes arguing for a defence of material being highly transformative and not competing with the original market this would allow a year old amateur to upload a video of herself miming to a sound track with impunity it doesnt have to be a radical change to the amendments but something that allows someone to remix a small amount of someone elses work and put it in a different context as long as its not for commercial purposes and doesnt compete with the original he says its pretty hard to see why something like that shouldnt be allowed new laws the federal government last week introduced its proposed changes to copyright law into parliament announcing the move attorney general philip ruddock said the bill demonstrated the governments commitment to ensuring laws reflect the continual changes to the technical landscape a spokesperson says following concerns about the bill debate has been adjourned while a senate committee gives the legislation further consideration the purpose of draft exposure bills is to circulate them for comment and expose any potential flaws before the legislation is introduced to parliament the spokesperson says obriens paper is also on the qut eprints website scientists study rio tinto in spain to learn more about mars the river has an extreme acidic ph and a high concentration of heavy metals yet microbes grow there so could the harsh conditions on mars also harbour life the us space agencys first experiments to look for organic matter on mars may not have been sensitive enough to detect life concludes a team of researchers studying martianlike soils in remote regions on earth the twin nasa viking probes landed on the surface of mars in to search for signs of past or present life one test involved rapidly heating soil samples so they vapourised leaving trace molecules to be analysed by spectrometers no biological materials were found and nasa abandoned ground exploration of mars for more than years but dr rafael navarrogonzaacutelez a researcher with the national autonomous university of mexico and colleagues have another explanation for the viking results writing in the latest issue of the proceedings of the national academy of sciences they say the experiment could have missed low levels of biological activity the researchers built their theory on studies conducted with vikingtype instruments in some of earths harshest environments the antarctic dry valleys the atacama desert of chile and peru and deserts in libya soil samples in those locations contain trace amounts of materials that viking would have missed despite inhospitable conditions soil samples from many of the teams test sites showed signs of life in the mars rover opportunity discovered an ironrich mineral called jarosite on the surface of mars points out navarrogonzaacutelez the same mineral is known to exist in spains river rio tinto so i decided to collect sediments from this river which has a very acidic ph high levels of iron and yet the presence of microorganisms from the three domains of life he says the team also discovered that ironrich soils could oxidise organic molecules into carbon dioxide further reducing the amount of material left behind this finding also might explain the high levels of carbon dioxide the viking instruments measured in the martian soil say the researchers the martian surface could have several orders of magnitude more organics than the stated viking detection limit the authors write while most scientists believed vikings findings to be clearcut others were not convinced dr gilbert levin one of the missions lead scientists has long maintained that his lifedetection experiment found living microorganisms in the soil of mars researchers now also believe that the best place to look for signs of life is underground which is more protected from solar radiation nasas current approach to mars exploration is to look for signs of past and presentday water which is believed to be necessary to support life over the past years nasa has dispatched a series of increasingly sophisticated probes to mars to survey minerals and geological formations from above the planets surface and to analyse soil and rock chemistry with rovers on the ground we suggest that the design of future organic instruments for mars should include other methods to be able to detect extinct andor extant life the authors conclude nasas next two landers the phoenix mission and the mars science laboratory both include instruments to analyse soil samples for water carbon dioxide and organic materials europes exomars mission slated for launch in or is designed to characterise the biological environment on mars cloning a mammoth was one of professor hwang woosuks sideline projects but who do you call when you need tissue samples disgraced south korean stem cell scientist professor hwang woosuk says he spent private donations for research to pay the russian mafia for mammoth tissues to clone extinct species hwang once celebrated as a national hero was indicted in may on charges of fraud and embezzlement after prosecutors said he was the mastermind of a scheme to make it look like his team had produced stem cells through cloning human embryos he previously told a seoul court that he spent part of more than us million in corporate donations for peripheral activities related to research some of the money was spent in contacting the russia mafia as we tried to clone mammoths hwang told the court during a hearing this week but you cant say that on the expense claim so we expensed it as money for cows for experiment hwang previously said he obtained mammoth tissues from glaciers and tried to clone them three times but failed prosecutors have charged hwang with fraud to secure funds and misusing us million in state funds and private donations as well as violating bioethics laws in procuring human eggs for research an investigation panel at seoul national university where hwang once worked said his team fabricated key data in the two papers on embryonic stem cells that were once heralded misuse of state funds carries a penalty of up to years in jail while violating the bioethics laws can lead to three years imprisonment prosecutors say hwang denied any of the funds were used for anything other than research he described extra expenses incurred when trying to secure animal ovaries in addition to paying for junior researchers housing and travel do you know how hard it is to secure four or five animal ovaries at butcher shops you need to keep the workers there happy he says surgeons may perform a full face transplant within months the worlds first full face transplant which was authorised by a uk medical watchdog this week is hedged with technical psychological and ethical challenges experts say the green light given to surgeon mr peter butler by the ethics committee at londons royal free hospital opens the way to an operation that could take place within months but the decision was reached cautiously reflecting an agonising debate about safety these fears were only eased after french doctors last november carried out the first partial face transplant and in july pronounced it a success these are the main challenges from a full facial graft say experts surgery nerves and the main vessels that carry blood to the face are connected by surgery under a microscope this task is common in reconstructive surgery and has a high success rate of the hand transplants that have been carried out on people over the past eight years only two have failed but microsurgery also carries a risk of transplant failure from clots that may form within the connected blood vessels in the first few days after surgery immunosupressors these powerful drugs inhibit the immune system so that the transplanted tissue is not attacked by the bodys defences but they also make the body more vulnerable to infection and disease in addition heavy use of immunosuppressors boosts the risk of cancer the danger of lifethreatening diseases poses an ethical problem because before the transplant the recipient was generally healthy to counter the immunosuppressor problem doctors may give the graft recipient tiny doses of material from the donor so that his or her immune system becomes accustomed to the tissue and therefore stops attacking it the technique is still experimental but has had promising results with kidney transplant patients doctors who performed the partial face transplant on isabelle dinoire last november also gave her a bone marrow graft from the donor psychological selecting the patient with the right profile is one of the hardest tasks of all the face is the mark of ones identity so wearing someone elses face or seeing someone else with the face of a deceased relative for instance may be deeply disturbing for some but the operation is new which means noone really knows for sure how it will work on the positive side computer modelling suggests facial tissue looks quite different and may be even unidentifiable when attached to someone else because the underlying bones and muscles fill it out differently every graft of a visible organ leads to an identity split the consequences of which can be very serious if the recipient does not succeed in psychologically accepting the organ and in rebuilding its social expression in everyday life french experts wrote in the lancet in july the right candidate is therefore someone who is robust and does not entertain the belief that the operation will miraculously restore their former lives a hope that fades to bitterness and alienation when complications inevitably occur seen as alien in the case of the worlds first hand transplant recipient clint hallam begged to have the new limb cut off because he viewed it as alien thorough psychological preparation is vital to the successful selection of patients says the face trust a charity set up to fund research for surgical reconstruction and face transplants the challenge we face is that the people who cope least well with facial injury may also be the people who cope least well with facial transplantation and its longterm impact on lifestyle sequencing the honey bee genome could improve the search for genes linked to social behaviour scientists have unravelled the genetic code of the honey bee uncovering clues about its complex social behaviour heightened sense of smell and african origins the results published in the journal nature makes the bee the third insect to have its genome mapped and joins the fruit fly and mosquito in the exclusive club the honey bee or apis mellifera evolved more slowly than the other insects but has more genes related to smell in biology and biomedicine honey bees are used to study many diverse areas including allergic disease development gerontology neuroscience social behaviour and venom toxicology says professor gene robinson director of the university of illinois and one of the leaders of the project the honey bee genome project is ushering in a bright era of bee research for the benefit of agriculture biological research and human health he adds with its highly evolved social structure of tens of thousands of worker bees commanded by the queen the honey bee genome could also improve the search for genes linked to social behaviour but the consortium of scientists which includes australians says a comprehensive analysis of the honey bee and other species will be needed to understand its social life the queen lives times as long as workers and lays up to eggs a day despite having tiny brains honey bees display honed cognitive abilities and learn to associate a flowers colour shape and scent with food which increases its foraging ability the scientists who analysed the genetic code have discovered the honey bee originated in africa and spread to europe in two ancient migrations the african bees spread throughout the new world is a spectacular example of biological invasion the scientists write the number of genes in honey bees related to smell outnumber those linked to taste the insects also have fewer genes than the fruit fly or mosquito for immunity honey bees use pheromones substances secreted by glands to distinguish the gender caste and age of other bees according to the scientists this dna sequence is a major step towards answering a basic question of social evolution at the genomic level what does it take to engineer an advanced colonial insect says professor edward wilson of harvard university in a commentary on the research researchers say their system of injecting ethanol into the engine saves petrol and costs consumers less than a hybrid car injecting small quantities of ethanol into car engines at moments of peak demand could improve fuel economy us scientists say researchers at the massachusetts institute of technology mit say a little squirt into the engine when the car is accelerating sharply or climbing a steep hill could improve fuel economy by the researchers say such as system would allow carmakers to use smaller engines in their vehicles they say this would reduce weight and improve fuel economy at a lower cost to consumers than by adding a hybrid engine to have a big impact on reducing oil consumption one needs a lowcost way of improving efficiency so a lot of people buy the car says dr daniel cohn senior research scientist at mit he estimates that adding the ethanol injection system to a car would cost about us a and that cars using the new system could be in mass production by we view it as a very important nearterm way to reduce oil consumption cohn says the scientists say their system would only use small amounts of ethanol and cohn estimates the ethanol tank in cars using the technology would need to be refilled every three months or so a turbocharger is added to produce more power the ethanol injection system with the turbocharger would give a driver more power than a conventional engine of the same size the scientists say how about knock the higher pressures and temperatures of a turbocharged engine can lead to a problem known as knock which occurs when the fuel and air in the engine explode prematurely hurting performance and potentially damaging the engine cohn says his groups technology avoids that problem by injecting ethanol into the engine when knock is likely to occur the ethanol vaporises and cools the fuelair mixture keeping it from exploding until the engine is ready this is a very special feature of ethanol cohn says the researchers are developing and testing their system with car manufacturer ford today the amazon flows into the atlantic ocean but millions of years ago it flowed in the opposite direction even the most reliable geographical facts like the direction of the worlds largest river can change dramatically over geological time millions of years ago a new study suggests the amazon river flowed from east to west rather than the current eastward path to the atlantic ocean the evidence for this continentwide reversal comes from tiny dark virtually indestructible minerals called zircons that are perpetually recycled in the sandstones of the amazon basin people use the zircons in ancient sands to reconstruct continents to understand what might have been upstream says geologist russell mapes a doctoral candidate at the university of north carolina in chapel hill very often zircons are the only mineral remnants of longgone mountain ranges geologists know this thanks to new technology that measures the age of the minerals by the minute quantities of uranium and lead isotopes within them the isotopes reveal how long it has been since the zircon solidified from molten rock in the case of the amazon zircons mapes with his us and brazilian colleagues discovered that the minerals dont come from the relatively young andes at all instead they are to billion years old that strongly suggests the zircons must have eroded out of some mountain range that bordered eastern south america back when it was still attached to africa before there was an atlantic ocean at all yet the zircons were found to the west of the region where they were born so the river must have once flowed in that direction the researchers conclude the rocks we saw on the river suggested this says mapes but when i got the actual data back i was happy ages later about million years ago the andes began to rise on the western edge of south america blocking the rivers passage to the pacific and shifting its flow to the east today the zircon is all that remains of the south americanafrican mountains mapes is due to present the discovery this week at the meeting of the geological society of america in philadelphia you couldnt tell this without this new tool says geologist dr paul link of idaho state university referring to the technology to sample individual layers of zircon minerals with precision and then count the isotope atoms to gauge age link is working on a similar drainage reversal in north america even further back in time i think that what it illustrates is that when a new tool is developed then all of a sudden you can make interesting conclusions about which way rivers drained he says that in turn can reveal how very different the world once was even things like huge rivers are very temporary in the scheme of earth time says mapes mastodons faught hormonally charged battles at certain times of the year battle scars on male mastodon tusks show these ice age giants were not the peaceful creatures once thought according to new findings the scars reveal they fought in brutal combat each year during seasonal phases of heightened sexual activity and aggression the discovery announced at a recent society of vertebrate paleontology meeting in ontario counters the view that nowextinct mastodons were peaceful passive creatures that rarely engaged in battles it also strengthens the link between mastodon and modern elephant behaviour since male bull elephants also fight seasonal hormonallycharged battles to show their dominance and win desired mates like warriors with different weapons however the two animals had distinct fighting techniques says lead author professor daniel fisher a university of michigan palaeontologist mastodon tusks curve upward strongly at the tips and appear to have been used in a vigorous upthrusting motion says fisher elephant tusks are less curved and therefore tend to be used more in a straight thrusting move he adds fishers analysis of mastodon tusks and skulls reveals that such ramming caused the lower part of the tusk to rotate backward crunching it against the back wall of the tusk socket he found that although the tusk continued to grow by adding layers of ivory to its base pitted scars line up along the outside curve of the tusk base its not just one event but a whole series of events that is preserved in this tusk record of fighting he says depends on the season using previous research about mastodon tusk growth patterns fisher also found the scars correspond to seasonal patterns the pits formed each year of the adult male animals life during midspring to early summer studies on mastodon vertebrae also helped fill out a picture of gory battles between the creatures which were metres tall for example we have evidence of tusks stabbing into the vertebral column penetrating the space traversed by the spinal cord from a direction that implies the victim was already lying on his side on the ground in other words the violence went on even after one animal was down fisher says other fossils suggest some of the animals were butchered in autumn most likely by humans who may have caused or contributed to the extinction of mastodons years ago few broken bones dr jeffrey saunders curator and chair of geology at the illinois state museum says he has excavated over mastodons i always viewed them as being rather passive animals because i never found many broken bones maybe one or two broken ribs but i greatly respect dr fishers work and i continue to be openminded about the possibilities he says saunders who once found himself between two fighting bull male elephants while in a small jeep adds i also think its interesting that similarities between mastodons and modern elephants seem to persist given that these animals parted evolutionary ways million years ago the basic elephant design must be successful to have persisted so long a botai village with its horse yards would have looked like this evidence from soil inside the remains of a yearold horse yard indicates that the ancient botai people of kazakhstan were among the earliest to domesticate horses but the botai probably ate and milked their horses as often as they rode them the horse yards are part of an archaeological site in northern kazakhstan known as krasnyi yar this was once a large village occupied by the copper age botai says dr sandra olsen curator at the carnegie museum of natural history in pittsburgh who leads a team that has been investigating horse domestication for years associate professor rosemary capo a geologist colleague from the university of pittsburgh presented some of the soil evidence for horses this week at a geological society of america meeting in philadelphia we really dont understand any major signs of changes in horses with domestication says dr melinda zeder an archaeologist at the smithsonian institution who specialises in the origins of animal and plant domestication zeder refers to physical changes in horse bones from ancient middens nor so far is there a direct way to determine what people were doing with their horses that early on she says for these reasons she and her colleagues have been building their case with less direct evidence heres an approach to documenting horse domestication thats extremely new says zeder of the evidence presented at the conference sort of like perry mason theyre building circumstantial evidence that evidence comes from circular arrangements of posts and the soil differences found inside and outside the horse yard comparing soils inside the yard the soil contained up to times the phosphorus as outside soils but lower concentrations of nitrogen thats what youd expect if the soil inside the yard was enriched with horse manure modern horse manure for comparison is loaded with phosphorous potassium and nitrogen the nitrogen is the easiest to lose to groundwater or the air phosphorus on the other hand can be held in place by calcium and iron says capo one of the scientists who analysed the soil high phosphorous could also indicate human occupation says capo but thats usually accompanied by other geochemical signatures which we didnt find in the horse yard samples there was also high sodium concentration in the horse yard samples which could be from urine suggests olsen smoking gun the real smoking gun says olsen will be if they can detect longlived molecules of fat in these samples that can be attributed specifically to horses that analysis is now being arranged so what were the botai doing with those horses olsen says they probably ate them and used them as pack animals they may also have milked the mares to create a vitaminrich mildly alcoholic beverage thats still consumed today in kazakhstan antechinus females go to extraordinary lengths to make sure their offspring survive some female marsupials have sex with as many males as possible to produce the fittest and healthiest offspring australian researchers report the brown antechinus antechinus stuartii usually only breeds once in her life so she has added pressure to make sure her young have the best chance of surviving researchers report in todays issue of the journal nature how the mouselike marsupial stores the sperm of many suitors for up to two weeks in her ova ducts sperm from the strongest males then go on to fertilise her prized eggs and the result may be up to eight healthy offspring sired from four strong males dr diana fisher and colleagues from the australian national university conducted two separate mating experiments in the first they took female marsupials from the wild and when they were in season allowed them to mate either with a single male or with three different males every two days a year later they replicated the experiment but kept lactating females in captivity until just before weaning this allowed the researchers to determine whether the previous benefit of polyandry depended on stressful conditions in their natural habitat or could be replicated in the laboratory they found the females in both populations werent particularly fussy and given the chance mated happily with multiple partners the only males they avoided in the wild were those that were obviously picked on by other males those perceived as weak by experimentally assigning mates to females we were able to show that polyandry females mating with more than one male during the mating season greatly increases offspring survival fisher says dna profiling shows that males that gain high paternity under sperm competition sire offspring that are more viable while many females in the animal and plant world mate with multiple partners researchers have been at a loss to explain why after all the practice can be costly in terms of egg production disease and injury earlier studies suggested polyandry yielded genetic benefits and could increase offspring survival but until now the reasons why were unclear and the same effects had yet to be proved for mammals in the wild the researchers conclude that the practice of polyandry leads to better quality offspring an important factor in light of the fact that the marsupial will usually breed only once in her lifetime adverts that use thin models can make you reach for the biscuit tin young women obsessed with their own body image eat more food after looking at magazine adverts that feature the ideal thin body research shows but those with a healthier body image who you might expect to be less influenced by the adverts eat less the australian study shows that advertising affects eating behaviour just not necessarily the way we think the researchers publish their study in the november issue of the journal eating behaviors fiona monro a phd student at the university of new south wales tries to explain the results we would expect people who value the way they look would be reminded by viewing the image and not eat she says were not sure why we found the reverse but possibly because of stress women obsessed with their appearance see the idealised image and think about their own body so turn to food they might think whats the point im never going to look like that i may as well eat or the image makes them think theyre thinner than they are so they eat more two hours after their last meal monro asked female university students to rank the importance of physical attractiveness health and physical fitness to determine whether they value the way their body looks more or less than the way it functions the researchers were interested in the notion of selfobjectification the way some people view themselves and their bodies as an object to be valued for external appearance the womens answers categorised women as low or high selfobjectifiers with high selfobjectifiers valuing appearance more participants then viewed six magazine advertisements for bodyrelated products like diet pills some containing images of idealised female models some not bodyobsessed people or high objectifiers ate more food sweet and savoury biscuits and sweet biscuits after viewing idealised body adverts than adverts without models low objectifiers ate less food after seeing idealised images than the other adverts theres no doubt these images have an effect on some women and can lead to changes in eating behaviour especially when you consider how many images people are exposed to every day monro says she says in future eating disorders might be reduced by identifying highobjectifiers in schools enabling education to change emphasis on appearance and promote a broader acceptance of body shapes this footprint was made by a twolegged dinosaur that walked along a sandy beach million years ago scientists studying how emus walk have brought to life the mysterious moves of twofooted jurassic dinosaurs travelling along a longlost beach computer models have been developed to simulate the gait and therefore the possible tracks of specific dinosaurs but live emus allow scientists to directly compare complex tracks to specific behaviours say researchers looking at the thousands of tracks left behind million years ago by dinosaurs at red gulch in northern wyoming among the surprises theyve found is that tracks once interpreted as steady walking may actually be created by the animals stopping at midstride another enigmatic type of track that now makes sense is where the dinosaurs appear to have crossed one leg over the other the motion is a seemingly weird thing to do until you watch an emu making the same sort of track says brent breithaupt director and curator of the university of wyomings geological museum emus it turns out have legs that are close together like many dinosaurs and tend to look around a lot as they walk breithaupt says this scanning behaviour causes emus to often cross the left foot over the right leg and the right foot over the left making the same confusing pattern seen in the dinosaur tracks sure enough there are wonderful comparisons says breithaupt emus are our biological rosetta stone he presented the latest on emus as proxies for dinosaurs at the recent geological society of america in philadelphia the search for a modern animal to act as a proxy for dinosaur tracks started says breithaupt because he was getting a little impatient with all the speculation about the tracks there was too much of what he calls prehistoric hyperbole so after passing on ostriches which have only two toes and rheas which have threetoes but overly rambunctious personalities emus were the best alternative plus there was an emu ranch just across the state line in colorado breithaupt and his team now think that the red gulch dinosaurs were probably humansized meat eaters or theropods travelling along in groups the groups may have included families since there are juvenile and adults tracks together implying some sort of parental care exactly what the dinosaurs looked like however is a mystery because the midjurassic period is particularly poor in dinosaur fossils in north america there is virtually nothing known about dinosaurs in north america from that time says geologist dr erik kvale who discovered the tracks and did a great deal of the first geological work there chances are there were some very gregarious behaviours of dinosaurs at red gulch but its only a snapshot what can be said with more certainty is that the dinosaurs were walking in a very different landscape than today says kvale the sands beneath their feet were carbonate sands like those found in the bahamas or the florida keys but the climate of the ancient shoreline was probably a lot drier the persian gulf is a better analogue says kvale nasa is discussing whether a shuttle mission to repair the hubble space telescope is worth the risk after all the time money anguish and work to return the space shuttle fleet to flight the us space agency still has one lingering question to resolve can a shuttle mission be sent to save hubble if not for the columbia disaster the fifth servicing call to the hubble space telescope probably would have happened by now that mission would have left the yearold observatory with fresh batteries replacement gyroscopes for steering and two new science instruments such upgrades could keep hubble on the cutting edge of astronomical research delving into questions such as the nature of the mysterious dark energy that seems to be driving the universes expansion and what the universe looked like as its earliest structures emerged after the big bang but after the columbia accident shuttle flights that do not go to the space station where astronauts can seek shelter in case their ship is too damaged to fly home were considered too risky and the hubble house call was cancelled nasa looked into a robotic servicing mission instead but found the cost and complexity of such a mission too daunting meanwhile public outrage over nasas decision to let the popular space telescope fester culminating in a pledge by the new head of nasa to reconsider flying one last flight to hubble now with three postcolumbia flights complete the time has come to decide hubbles fate nasa is considering if the safety upgrades implemented after the accident offset the risk of flying with few options available to save a stranded shuttle crew hubble is definitely sort of the comeback kid so hopefully it will be able to do it one more time says professor adam riess an astronomer with the space telescope science institute in baltimore i would expect that this is the final meeting he adds now its a matter of coming up a with a decision shuttle program workers have certainly done their homework the first order of business was to fix problems with debris falling off the ships fuel tank during launch a chunk of insulating foam broke off columbias tank during liftoff and smashed a hole in the wings heat shield as the shuttle attempted to return to earth days later superheated atmospheric gases blasted into the breach destroying the shuttle and killing the seven astronaut crew nasas first tank redesign tested during a july flight of shuttle discovery failed to prevent dangerously large pieces of foam from falling off the tank a second redesign was tested a year later and this time the tank was deemed safe enough to resume flights the shuttle program also demonstrated how the ships robot arm and newly added extension boom could be used during flight to scrutinise the shuttles heat shield for damages astronauts also tested using the boom as a work platform in case repairs were needed to fix heat shield holes before attempting atmospheric reentry finally engineers developed rudimental heat shield repair kits and techniques but there is no getting around the issue of flying without an orbital safe hubbles orbit is too far from the station for a shuttle to get there theoretically nasa could severely cut shuttle power and keep a crew in orbit for several weeks until another shuttle could be launched on a rescue mission but there is no guarantee the flight could be launched on time or that another problem might not also strike the rescue ship you just dont have the orbital lifetime on a hubble mission to be able to get another vehicle launched says deputy shuttle program manager john shannon were going to have to go into the hubble decision not counting on the launchonneed vehicle he says thats the difficult question the agencys going to have do we have enough confidence in the tank design do we have enough confidence in our inspection and repair to be able to do that i think thats where the discussion is mostly going to lie another issue is whether to risk a shuttle and crew on a hubble flight when nasa is under a strict deadline to finish the space station before when the shuttles are to be retired the agency needs at least more construction missions and wants two additional flights beyond that to deliver heavy equipment and spare parts to the outpost in a recently released flight schedule agency managers set aside a hubble servicing mission for april station assembly which resumed with last months flight of shuttle atlantis would be complete in july under the new manifest without a servicing mission astronomers expect hubble to last only another two or three years before its batteries give out even before then the finicky gyroscopes could break or the cameras could fail it would really be a blow says astronomer dr harry ferguson also with the space telescope science institute i think everyone is really quite hopeful that a repair mission will happen were waiting with bated breath if it gets upgrades hubble should last until at least that means it could still be operational when its sharpeyed infrared replacement the james webb space telescope arrives in orbit to begin its fiveyear mission the webb observatory which is not designed for servicing by astronauts is scheduled for launch in june industrial aerosols dont just affect air quality but also the temperature of our oceans a projected drop in air pollution will affect global ocean currents and could cause a marked rise in water temperature in the southern hemisphere the author of a new study says dr wenju cai and colleagues from csiro marine and atmospheric research are the first to model the impact of changing levels of particulate air pollution or aerosols on ocean currents they publish their findings in the journal geophysical research letters cai says air pollution like sulfate organic particles and black carbon produced from fossil fuel burning transport emissions and power plants has increased rapidly over the past years but tighter regulation and a worldwide move towards cleaner fuels means some projections have aerosols dropping to pre levels by around cai says this however has a downside less air pollution means sunlight can more easily reach earth which many researchers say could mean higher temperatures cai says rises in surface and water temperature could also cause a slowdown in the socalled worldwide conveyor belt an ocean circulation system that transports heat from southern hemisphere oceans to those in the north so cleaner air will result in colder northern hemisphere temperatures and warmer waters in the south cai says that will have a big impact in europe and the northern hemisphere because the conveyor belt is sending heat to that part of the globe he says in the southern hemisphere we will get warmer faster and the rise in sea levels will accelerate cai says warming will be most rapid in the tasman sea which could heat up by c by with major implications for marine life and ecosystems how do aerosols influence ocean currents aerosols keep the earth cool by reflecting away solar radiation says cais coauthor and csiro colleague dr john church so they are thought to mask some of the effects of global warming but because industrial development has produced a higher concentration of aerosols in the northern hemisphere than the south in the past the cooling effect has been more marked in the north cooler northern hemisphere temperatures should mean cooler northern oceans and cooler waters should equate with lower sea levels this wasnt the case says church instead the study found evidence that the cooling waters had intensified movement of the conveyer belt speeding up delivery of heat from south to north reversal the situation may reverse once aerosol levels fall cai says effectively causing a slowdown in the transport of heat from the southern hemisphere to the north cai says an exaggerated version of this scenario was the basis for the hollywood movie the day after tomorrow in which a change in ocean currents produces a new ice age church says its unclear exactly how dropping aerosol levels will affect global temperatures when combined with rising temperatures associated with the greenhouse effect we dont understand the aerosol forcing as well as greenhouse so theres a question of how much of the global warming is compensated by aerosols he says if its a small amount as we reduce the aerosols in the atmosphere there wont be a rapid acceleration of climate change but if theyre actually masking a very large amount then as we reduce the aerosols that has big implications australia is developing the worlds first koala sperm bank zoos around the world will soon be able to breed their own koalas without having to fly in breeding stock from australia researchers say they say new technology to preserve sperm will allow koala sperm to be exported from australia for the first time university of queensland reproductive biologist and team leader dr steve johnston says the researchers have been able to extend the shelf life of the sperm to hours theyve done this by diluting the semen in a special ph balanced solution containing nutrients and antibiotics and keeping it chilled the team this week unveiled eight koala joeys born from artificial insemination with the diluted semen being able to dilute the semen is the first step in being able to provide frozen specimens internationally and interstate johnston says this is because fresh koala semen only lasts a couple of hours and the fragility of the cells means they dont easily survive freezing and thawing the team now plans to set up the worlds first koala sperm bank what do koalas and camels have in common johnston says koalas like camels have a special factor in their sperm which triggers ovulation in the female what we found was theres a combination between the mating itself and the factor in the semen which causes the brain to release luteinising hormone which results in the ovulation process he says diluting the semen without affecting the ovulation factor was a major challenge for researchers he says diluting is a first step because if youre going to freeze something you have to put it into a diluent which allows you to put cryoprotectants in the fluid to protect the sperm against freezing he says the other thing is when you dilute the sperm you dont have to use as much you dont waste as much sperm when inseminating low sperm count koalas have a relatively low sperm count with only about million sperm per ejaculation compared with echidnas which have times that amount johnston says being able to send a frozen sperm sample internationally will make it easier to introduce genetic diversity to koala populations and setting up a sperm bank will help conservation efforts in australia and enable samples to be screened for common koala diseases like chlamydia and retroviruses but dont hold your breath about buying your very own koala sperm online johnston says the queensland government is making sure that none of that will happen mathematicians say you can have your cake and eat it too if youre prepared to do the sums mathematicians have devised a fairer way to share a cake according to new research it allows you to choose a slice with more chocolate icing but the tradeoff is that you get a smaller piece the research which is based on the principle of surplus procedure is published in the notices of the american mathematical society the traditional way of dividing a cake is the cut and choose approach where one person cuts the cake in two and the other chooses a half write professor michael jones and colleagues from montclair state university in new jersey while this ensures both people get the same sized portion it doesnt necessarily mean they are equally happy for example one may like chocolate icing sprinkles or cream more than the other surplus procedure to even this out the researchers propose people tell a referee how much they value certain qualities of a cake the referee then uses these weighted values to calculate where to cut the cake in an ideal world both parties would get of what they want but in reality theres a compromise jones says his teams algorithms ensure that both parties get about of what they want based on the principle of giving each person at least of the cake plus the surplus as they value it the catch is that the system depends on honesty and requires a referee and a calculator the surplus procedure system can be used for two or three people jones says but doesnt work quite as well for three or more he says the method can also be applied to other heterogeneous and divisible items like dividing land or deciding how much rent each flatmate pays the wedge system dr burkard polster an australian mathematician from monash university isnt convinced the proposed method is best how do you associate a number with something like happiness he says if you really wanted to sell this to a year old they wouldnt go for it theyd still think the other piece is better he says a square cake for example can be cut into five fairly by using the equation that says the area of a triangle equals the length of its base times its height divided by two the cake cant be cut into equal squares because there will only be four pieces and it cant be cut into parallel pieces because the pieces on the edge will have more icing if the cake is iced around the edge and not just on top the answer is to cut the cake in equally sized wedges if the cake has a perimeter of centimetres you start at one corner and measure centimetres and make a mark then you go around until youre back to the beginning and you have five marks from those marks you cut through the middle and those wedges will be exactly one fifth eggs and sandwiches polster says applying surplus procedure to cakes isnt the first time maths has been used to share food the egg yolk theory describes how best to divide a fried egg into pieces with an equal portion of yolk and white and he says the ham sandwich theory makes sure you can cut a sandwich and get equal amounts of ham lettuce and bread a vending machine containing a new type of printer could churn out a novel in an instant an innovative printer head may lead to affordable printers that spew out a thousand pages per minute its developers say such printers could lead to fast highquality photo printing as well as ondemand printed media say the researchers imagine customised newspapers and magazine and instant books printed by a vending machine think of such a machine in an airport terminal you slide your credit card chose a book for your flight and get it warm from the printer in less than a minute says dr moshe einat senior lecturer at the college of judea and samaria in ariel israel and team member the jetrix printer head invented by colleague nissim einat and team could be on the market in two years in printers costing uu the researchers say the machine could reduce backups at the office printer too today even the best printers used for business purposes cost thousands of dollars and max out at about pages per minute the speed is limited in part by the printer head for starters its usually much smaller than the page and takes time to scan back and forth while applying the ink nozzle redesign the other challenge has to do with the nozzles the ink is typically pooled in a main reservoir and distributed through a chamber or manifold that has many branching tubes each leading to a nozzle to get uniform drops the pressure of the ink in this system must be precisely regulated and maintained a delicate task that becomes more difficult as the number of nozzles and the size of the nozzle array increases overcoming obstacles the jetrix overcomes conventional limitations in two ways first it does not have a main reservoir or manifold that requires delicate pressure maintenance second it is not limited by size in fact it can be as large as piece of paper and theoretically has a nozzle for every pixel the difference has to do with the way einat and his team built the printer head they turned to the same technology used to manufacture computer chips etching the printer head out of silicon wafer chips instead of a small array of nozzles that makes many scans to print a page the design is a flat d panel designed to be as big as the page and eject all of the necessary ink simultaneously although the approach has a number of innovative features it also has limitations says dr ross allen an internationally recognised technologist based in st helena california who has patents in imaging and printing technology inkjet print heads typically make two to eight passes over the same pixel row in order to hide any defects caused by nozzles that dont operate or meet drop ejection specifications says allen if einats print head lays down all of the ink at once the printed page could show artefacts or flaws from bad nozzles printing in colour printing in colour could also present a challenge youll need black cyan magenta and yellow pagesize print heads printing in precise registration says allen finally he says no matter how fast a printer head applies ink it doesnt get around the basic limitation that the ink must dry before the page is stacked in the paper tray whos that oh its me when presented with a jumbosized mirror elephants recognise their reflections and investigate the inside of their mouths and ears according to a new study such selfawareness is rare until the paper published online today in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences scientists believed only humans apes and dolphins possessed selfrecognition skills all these animals are highly intelligent and seem to feel empathy a quality that is probably linked to selfawareness what they have in common is complex sociality that includes high levels of cooperation altruism and large brains says coauthor dr frans de waal a psychology professor at emory university in atlanta in literature about human children there is speculation as to how increased selfawareness makes it possible to set the self apart from others which in turn permits the self to take the others perspective a prerequisite for complex forms of empathy says de waal director of the living links center at the universitys yerkes national primate research center for the study de waal and colleagues dr diana reiss and joshua plotnik introduced three adult female asian elephants happy patty and maxine to a large mirror placed in their exhibit at the bronx zoo in new york city according to the paper animals typically have a social response towards the reflection they see in the mirror they then try to inspect the mirror such as by looking behind it most animals such as parrots dogs and cats show these behaviours but the three elephants had different reactions to their reflections each elephant played a sort of peekaboo by swaying their heads trunks and bodies in and out of mirror view they even brought food in front of the mirror and watched themselves eat maxine took her trunk and stuck it in her mouth as though she were investigating the inside of her oral cavity she also used her trunk to pull her ear slowly forward towards the mirror x marks the spot the researchers next painted two x marks on the foreheads of the elephants one mark was invisible to control for odour and tactile cues the other fully visible this mark test is the scientific standard for determining whether an animal recognises itself in a mirror as soon as happy saw the visible mark she touched it with her trunk in front of the mirror she did this times maxine and patty however ignored the marks on their foreheads we believe that because elephants love to dustbathe and throw food and dirt on their backs for storage such a relatively small mark on their head might not bother them says plotnik chimpanzees and humans groom themselves by picking things off their bodies while elephants love to be covered in dirt and mud hardly surprising dr lori marino a senior lecturer in neuroscience and behavioural biology at emory worked on the earlier dolphinmirror study she is not surprised that elephants can recognise themselves in the mirror like dolphins great apes and humans elephant brains are large and highly convoluted and their social lives are extraordinarily complex marino says she adds that many other animals possess selfawareness a multifaceted complex phenomenon which seems to manifest itself at different levels since elephant selfawareness and empathy are on a similar level to that of humans plotnik hopes the findings will strengthen our commitment towards conservation especially as the wild elephant population continues to plummet due to habitat loss and poaching a shuttle mission in will be the hubble space telescopes final service call the us space agency says it will launch a final space shuttle mission to keep the ageing hubble space telescope in orbit and operational the decision announced this week by nasa chief dr michael griffin follows a review of safety concerns and appeals from the scientific community to extend hubbles life without a repair mission which will probably be carried out in the telescope would shut down in or even earlier since it was launched into orbit years ago the telescope has helped astrophysicists peer deep into the universe free of the distortions from the earths atmosphere orbiting kilometres above the earth the hubble has enabled scientists to better measure the age and origins of the universe observe distant supernovas and identify and study bodies in and outside the solar system in it conveyed pictures of the most distant parts of the universe ever observed by visible light the deepest portrait of the visible universe ever achieved by humankind says the space telescope science institute nasa had scheduled a mission for hubble in but scrapped it after the columbia shuttle disintegrated while returning to earth the accident raised serious safety questions for nasa particularly with the shuttles heat shield this weeks announcement comes after two of the last three shuttle missions were judged a success safety review griffin says the decision to go ahead was taken after a painstaking review of safety issues were not going to risk a crew in order to do a hubble mission he told staff at the goddard space center nasa has said previously it was ready to refurbish the telescope as long as the mission did not put the space shuttle crew in jeopardy the hubble mission presents a challenge because the shuttle crew would not be able to seek refuge aboard the orbiting international space station if a serious problem arose nasa also is faced with a busy schedule of another missions to finish building the space station before retiring the entire shuttle program in or four missions a year a hubble mission would probably be set for early and would require a second shuttle to be ready for any rescue mission should the crew face an emergency a new mission to the hubble would replace the telescopes six stabilising gyroscopes and its batteries to extend its life astronauts would also repair an infrared spectrometer that has been broken since they would also install two new instruments including the wide field camera that would enhance images of dark matter and of the first galaxies that were formed after the big bang putting babies to sleep on their backs allows them to respond to their arousal reflexes an abnormality in part of the brain that controls breathing arousal and other reflexes may be what causes sudden infant death syndrome a finding that could lead to a preventive treatment a study says the discovery could explain why babies lying face down are more likely to die of sids in that position an infants reflexes including head turning and arousal are harder to trigger when breathing is challenged says the report from childrens hospital boston and harvard medical school the study published in this weeks journal of the american medical association was based on autopsy data from infants who had died from sids and who had died from other causes between and in california in the sids infants a look at the lowest part of the brainstem the medulla oblongata found abnormalities in nerve cells that make and use serotonin one of the chemicals in the brain that transmit messages between nerve cells serotonin and how it is processed in the brainstem may help coordinate breathing blood pressure sensitivity to carbon dioxide and temperature the report says when babies sleep face down or have their faces covered by bedding they are thought to breathe exhaled carbon dioxide back in depriving them of oxygen when that happens the carbon dioxide increase would normally trigger nerve cells in the brainstem which in turn stimulate respiratory and arousal centres in the brain a normal baby will wake up turn over and start breathing faster when carbon dioxide levels rise says dr hannah kinney of the boston hospital an author of the paper but babies with the defect die because the reflexes are impaired she says public health campaigns aimed at reducing the risk of sids have advised parents to put infants to sleep on their back and to avoid soft bedding sharing a bed with an infant smoking during pregnancy and smoking around a baby after birth among the sids infants in the new study were sleeping prone or on their side at the time of death indicating a need for continued public information on the problem the study says the findings may spur development of a diagnostic test to identify infants at risk or perhaps some day a drug or other type of treatment to protect infants with abnormal brainstem serotonin systems the authors say this finding lends credence to the view that sids risk may greatly increase when an underlying predisposition combines with an environmental risk such as sleeping face down at a developmentally sensitive time in early life says dr duane alexander director of the us national institute of child health and human development which helped to pay for the study serious games are being developed to teach the us military how to defuse tense situations in iraq gamers are increasingly dropping virtual swords and guns and picking up serious subjects such as cancer or the iraq war injecting a dose of reality into the multibillion dollar sector a twoday serious games summit near washington saw some game designers publishers academic experts as well as representatives from the defence and health sectors share information about new serious games on the market that deal with realworld issues serious games are games used for some other serious pursuit than entertainment says ben sawyer codirector of the serious games initiative which held its first summit two years ago among games featured at the summit were the redistricting game which teaches administrators how legislative redistricting works humansim which tests medical diagnostic skills and tactical iraqi a program to train us soldiers with linguistic and cultural skills needed for missions in iraq that game largely funded by the us department of defense encourages soldiers who face various scenarios with virtual iraqis to use diplomacy to avoid or defuse tense situations players are also familiarised with basic iraqi culture in one episode for example two soldiers seeking information from local iraqis sitting in a cafe are shown how to introduce themselves to make clear they are not a threat and are told to take off their sunglasses as eye contact is important in iraqi culture clearly in hindsight a lot of this training should have been done earlier but the military recognises it now and is serious about it now and i see this as being a permanent change in the military say lewis johnson chief executive officer of tactical language and culture a californiabased company that developed the game at this point the us military is really taking the lead in emphasising the importance of understanding other cultures other languages the importance of communication he adds johnson says a number of countries have expressed interest in his companys products which include tactical pashto and tactical french for soldiers or civilian contractors working in afghanistan or in frenchspeaking african countries he says the company is also seeking to develop games for the general public and to be used in schools johnson sawyer and others attending the summit say they believe the serious games sector will gain popularity in coming years as more funding becomes available and as the super mario generation comes of age serious games has got very far to go but in a good way that is nowhere but up sawyer says as we start to unlock where we can use games and where they can be successful and as commercial gaming hurdles forward and we can gain by trailblazing technology they churn out the things we will be able to do two to three years from now will be more amazing sawyer says he expects the next big success story to be a serious game being developed to enable students to design their own game on a certain topic instead of writing a term paper you might design a game about running a state park owning a hotel or running an office he says the traffic lights dont need a master controller to tell them when to change a network of traffic lights that decides to turn green when lots of cars are waiting can help reduce traffic jams say researchers unlike other traffic light systems that are coordinated centrally these lights would optimise traffic flow by acting autonomously seungbae cools of the vrije universiteit brussel in belgium and colleagues report their findings in a paper posted on the arxiv preprint website traffic management aims to optimise traffic flow reduce traffic jams and cut the time drivers spend waiting at traffic lights green lights are synchronised into green waves to allow cars to flow through the main avenues of cities without facing a red light the idea is to make the speed of the green wave match the desired cruise speed for the street but if the green waves remain the same whatever the traffic condition this can lead to traffic problems when traffic is heavy cars entering a green wave will stop as there are cars ahead of them and once a car misses the green wave it has to wait the whole duration of the red light to enter the next green wave selforganising traffic lights most advanced traffic control management systems rely on a central computer to help optimise the flow of traffic but the belgian researchers have developed a system that relies on selforganising traffic lights they say the system relies purely on local interactions between cars and traffic lights to generate flexible green waves on demand at each traffic light there is a counter that is set to zero each time a light turns red and then counts the number of cars that build up at the lights if there are more cars approaching or waiting behind a red light this will turn into green faster than if there are only few cars say the researchers the researchers say the system can greatly improve traffic flow and they have tested this by feeding real traffic data from a brussels avenue into a traffic simulator adapting to traffic conditions but brent stafford of intelligent transport systems australia is not convinced the system does better than the latest adaptive traffic light systems as the name suggests adaptive systems adjust to current traffic conditions rather than say trigger green lights set on a timer one existing adaptive system developed in australia in the s is the sydney coordinated adaptive traffic system scats that now controls about intersections in countries around the world says stafford he says the belgian researchers compared their system to a less sophisticated system to this and he is not sure how realistic the traffic simulator they used was since it is nonstandard panacea for traffic jams and other experts warn against thinking such technology can be a panacea for traffic jams at the end of the day you will not be able to resolve traffic jams using just this particular concept says traffic control engineer professor ljubo vlacic of australias griffith university the belgian researchers agree saying efficient traffic control should not be an excuse to keep increasing the number of cars on our roads they stress alternatives to private cars such as cycling walking car sharing and public transport play an essential role the red wine molecule seems to mimic the benefits of eating less without the effort of dieting but will it work in humans a compound in red wine and grapes can extend the life span of obese mice and help them enjoy a healthier old age scientists say the molecule known as resveratrol not only enabled the mice to live longer than other overweight rodents it also reduced the negative health effects of eating a highcalorie diet resveratrol has been shown to have same effect in studies on yeast flies and worms but the scientists say their research is the first to show it works in mammals it is possible to find a molecule that activates the bodys natural defences against ageing you can use it to enhance the health of a mouse or mammal that is unprecedented says associate professor david sinclair of harvard medical school he adds that the study reported online today in the journal nature is proof of the principle that it works in mammals but the real test will be to develop formulations or find other molecules to treat agerelated illnesses such as diabetes alzheimers heart disease and cancer in humans researchers already know that restricting calories can prolong life in mice and other organisms resveratrol seems to mimic the beneficial effects of eating less without the hassle of dieting middleaged mice sinclair and an international team of scientists including australian researchers from the university of sydney analysed the impact of the molecule by studying three groups of middleaged mice one group ate a standard diet the second a highcalorie diet and the third had the same diet but were given supplements of resveratrol eight weeks after starting the study the scientists noticed a difference between the two highcalorie groups by the time the mice were weeks old in the highcalorie group had died compared to in the other groups after six months resveratrol essentially prevented most of the negative effects of the highcalorie diet in mice says dr rafael de cabo a coauthor of the study from the us national institute on aging the study is continuing but so far the compound has extended the life span in the highcalorie mice by about there is no question that we are seeing increased longevity says sinclair in addition to increasing survival the compound reduced the negative effects of being obese so the mice treated with resveratrol lived as long as the lean mice they had healthier heart and liver tissue decreased blood sugar levels better insulin sensitivity and were more active than the other rodents which genes are involved when the scientists looked at the genetic level to see which genes in the mice were switched on or off they found the molecule had changed the gene expression pattern of the obese mice towards that of lean mice the next step is to understand how the compound works sinclair and his colleagues believe a key component could be the sirt gene which is thought to be linked to life span extension sirtris pharmaceuticals a therapeutics company cofounded by sinclair has started a trial of a proprietary formulation of resveratrol in patients with type diabetes the real bang will be if somebody proves this is going to work in people sinclair adds pigs are the most important domestic animal of the pacific sacred pigs from vanuatu are shedding new light on how domestic pigs spread throughout the world say us and australian researchers dr koji lum from binghamton university in new york state and colleagues publish their study on pacific island pigs in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences pigs are the most important domestic animal in pacific cultures being an important source of food and a basis for societal wealth they are also sacred animals that some cultures believe have souls yet the origin of pacific pig breeds has long been unresolved lum and team studied mitochondrial dna or mtdna from two kinds of sacred pigs from the island nation of vanuatu one was a male of the narave type these intersex pigs dont produce enough steroid for complete masculinsation say the researchers so they cannot reproduce amongst themselves the breed is therefore carried forward by female carriers of the navare traits the second type of sacred pig was the hairless kapia lum and team which includes kirk huffman from the australian museum compared mtdna of the pigs from vanuatu to mtdna from pigs from burma vietnam china and the ryukyu islands they found that the narave pig dna matched the dna of those breeds domesticated in southeast asia over years ago this data suggests the navare pigs were recently domesticated within southeast asia and dispersed during the human colonisation of remote oceania associated with the lapita cultural complex write the researchers interestingly the researchers found that the other native pacific pig they studied kapia shared much of its dna with introduced european breeds two thirds of the dna from the kapia pig samples came from berkshire and large black breeds introduced by europeans the researchers say these breeds would have been chosen for crossing with native breeds because they had the same dark coat as the natives ensuring the offspring remained protected from the tropical sun nice but only half the story a previous study comparing pig skulls by professor colin groves of the australian national university also concluded southeast asia was the most likely origin of pacific pigs the lum study is a nice little confirmation of what we already suspected says groves but he says using mtdna which comes through the maternal line means the researchers are only finding out the origin of the female pigs theyre only getting half the story here he says groves says if they tested the dna from the y chromosome of the kapia for example they may find the main source of the recently introduced pig dna was via the use of introduced boars rather than sows groves says that while most of the domestic pigs that are widespread in the world today come from europe they are actually ultimately of either chinese origin or half chinese and half european he says european farmers bred their pigs with the fatter chinese breeds to get a better domestic animal in less than years fish markets like this one in india may not have any produce to sell the worlds fish and seafood populations will collapse by if current trends in habitat destruction and overfishing continue resulting in less food for humans researchers say when they analysed scientific data going back to the s and historical records over a thousand years they found that marine biodiversity the variety of ocean fish shellfish birds plants and microorganisms had declined dramatically some of species were already in collapse extending this pattern into the future the scientists calculate that by all species would be in collapse which the researchers defined as having catches decline from the maximum catch this applies to all species from mussels and clams to tuna and swordfish says assistant professor boris worm lead author of the study which is published today in the journal science ocean mammals including seals killer whales and dolphins are also affected whether we looked at tide pools or studies over the entire worlds ocean we saw the same picture emerging says worm from dalhousie university in halifax nova scotia in losing species we lose the productivity and stability of entire ecosystems i was shocked and disturbed by how consistent these trends are beyond anything we suspected when ocean species collapse it makes the ocean itself weaker and less able to recover from shocks like global climate change worm says the decline in marine biodiversity is largely due to overfishing and destruction of habitat says worm overexploitation the loss of biodiversity makes ocean ecosystems less able to recover from the effects of global climate change pollution and overexploitation worm says he likens a diverse ocean environment to a diversified investment portfolio with lots of different species in the oceans just as with lots of different kinds of investments you spread the risk around worm says in the ocean ecosystem were losing a lot of the species in our stock portfolio and by that were losing productivity and stability by losing stability were losing the ability of the system to selfrepair to help depleted areas rebuild marinelife reserves and nofishing zones need to be set up the authors say with marine reserves in place fishing near the reserves can improve as much as fourfold worm says beyond the economic benefits to coastal communities where fishing is a critical industry there are environmental benefits to rebuilding marine biodiversity the scientists say depleted coastal ecosystems are vulnerable to invasive species disease outbreaks coastal flooding and noxious algae blooms they report certain kinds of aquaculture like the traditional chinese cultivation of carp using vegetable waste can also be beneficial according to the scientists but farms that aim to raise carnivorous fish are less effective mercury will cross the face of the sun early thursday morning australian time just like it did when this image was taken in australians are in a prime position to see mercury moving across the sun this week an event they wont be able to see again for another years the transit which can be seen using amateur telescopes on thursday morning australian time is of particular interest to historians astronomer dr nick lomb of sydney observatory says the transit of mercury in was the original astronomical event that triggered european colonisation of australia and not the transit of venus as commonly thought there is a very direct link between the transit of mercury and the fact that we are here and speak english in australia says lomb on november edmond halley witnessed a transit of mercury from the south atlantic island of st helena lomb says this led him to suggest the idea that planetary transits could be used to work out the scale of the solar system in particular how far the earth was from the sun and this eventually led to james cooks voyage to tahiti to observe the transit of venus in which in turn resulted in the british colonisation of australia today scientists use the transit of mercury and venus to study the chemical composition of the planets atmospheres as a planet passes in front of the sun scientists can use spectroscopy to deduce information about its atmosphere by comparing the difference in the electromagnetic spectrum given off by the sun and the planet transits can also be used the study the momentary dimming of stars as a planet passes in front of it a phenomenon used to detect planets circulating stars other than the sun mercury transits the sun on average times a century says lomb more frequently than venus which only transits twice a century transits of mercury occur in either may or november when mercury is closer to the sun and the next one will not occur until the next transit visible from australia will not be until a targeted approach to weeds rather than spraying the whole field could reduce costs and be safer for humans and the environment a solarpowered robot could help farmers pinpoint and destroy weeds significantly reducing the use of herbicides its developers say the autonomous agricultural robot or agbot has been designed by engineers at the university of illinois at urbanachampaign it uses cameras and vision recognition software to seek out weeds cut them down and apply a precise amount of herbicide to the root the targeted approach requires fewer chemicals and minimises the risk that they will get into the environment whether carried by wind or water farmers typically apply herbicide to the entire field making no distinction between crop and weed the herbicide can become airborne or if it rains leech into ground water if inhaled or ingested in large quantities some herbicides can be harmful to people hong young jeon a phd candidate in agricultural and biological engineering and nathanael gingrich a masters student at the university saw an opportunity to address the problem working under the direction of agricultural engineer associate professor lei tian the team built a robot about metres long and centimetres wide solar powered a curved solar panel mounted to the top gathers solar energy to charge a battery and the battery powers two small cameras sensors a gps for navigation and an electric motor that drives the robot about kilometres per hour the panel also serves as a canopy to protect the machine from the elements and provides shade for the vision system the vision system although still in the beginning stages of development will be designed to recognise the shape and structure of plants and be able to distinguish between a weed and a corn plant when a weed is spotted a robotic arm attached to the front of the machine cuts the weed and then squirts herbicide onto the root the vision system will also allow the machine to recognise when it has arrived at the end of a row and to turn down the next lane currently an operator controls the robot but eventually it will work autonomously and a wireless connection between the robot and a laptop computer could make it easy for the farmer to operate the machine from the comfort of his house the farmer could control everything from the living room says jeon worth the cost soslashren marcus pederson a senior research fellow at denmarks royal veterinary and agricultural university in frederiksberg says surveys show that farmers are generally receptive to new technologies but there has to be an economic advantage for example using a small machine might require less fuel and would not compact the soil the way heavy machinery does there is a cost associated with the labour needed to undo the compacting that occurs each year says pedersen but a cost advantage may be hard to see on lowvalue crops such as rice and corn its difficult for me to see a huge breakthrough in cereal crops you have to start to focus on vegetables potatoes and sugar beets crops that have a relatively high value says pedersen reliable and the robots safety system would have to be reliable enough for it to operate autonomously its relatively costly to implement safety features on these robotic systems he says in principle they can work the whole day but if there is a requirement that it has to be attended then you have to limit your time for using these systems there will still be fish on the menu governments say despite warnings that stocks will be depleted within years governments and the un food agency have cast serious doubts on a major scientific study that predicts all marine fish and seafood species face will collapse by the un food and agriculture organization fao says that the conservation effort must be improved but it says that it is unlikely there would be no seafood on consumers plates by midcentury calling the report statistically dangerous such a massive collapse would require reckless behaviour of all industries and governments for four decades and an incredible level of apathy of all world citizens to let this happen without mentioning economic forces that would discourage this from happening says serge michel garcia director of the faos fishery resources division south koreas fisheries ministry labelled the report too radical and says more scientific data is needed before heeding the call of environmentalists like greenpeace to set aside of oceans as marine reserves the cry for urgent action came in the wake of a report published in the current issue of the journal science in the most exhaustive study conducted to date us and canadian researchers warned that overfishing and pollution threatened the accelerated loss of ocean species ecosystems and human food supplies the worldwide fishing industry currently extracts some million tonnes of fish each year from the worlds oceans according to the fao it represents a significant economic sector in many countries including scandinavia nations where officials expressed scepticism about the reports conclusions i dont think the oceans will be empty in years time says helga pedersen the norwegian minister of fisheries that said we have to work harder to secure sustainable management of fish stocks she adds nordic fishing unions say industrial overfishing is not in any case the main culprit sure there are threatened species but pollution is the main problem says lena talvitie vicepresident of the finnish federation of professional fishermen for environmentalists however the reports message was unequivocal overfishing and pirate fishing are destroying our oceans at an alarming rate says greenpeace spokesman nilesh goundar in australia some of fished species were considered collapsed in that is their catches had declined by or more says assistant professor boris worm of dalhousie university in canada lead author of the report the european commission reacted by urging better international cooperation to turn around any doomsday scenario on the worlds marine fish supply mice engineered to have a low body temperature live longer scientists show lowering the body temperature of mice without limiting the amount of food they eat can prolong their lives a new study shows according to a study in the latest issue of the journal science female mice live up to and males longer our study shows it is possible to increase life span in mice by modest but prolonged lowering of core body temperature says bruno conti an associate professor at scripps research institute in california who led the study but it will take a long time to determine if the same applies to humans the researchers say scientists know that body temperature and ageing are linked in reptiles and other coldblooded animals they also know that the life span of warmblooded creatures can be extended by reducing the number of calories they eat which in turn lowers the body temperature by slowing down the metabolism so the researchers carried out the study to determine whether calorie reduction is indeed responsible for extending animals life with a lowering of the body temperature being a secondary effect or whether the latter is actually the cause of the increased longevity they found that the increased life span is due to the lower body temperature independent of the amount the mice eat cooling down a mouse in the study the researchers lowered the body temperature of the mice degc by genetically manipulating them they created mice that produce large amounts of a type of protein in the brain this acts to heat up the brains thermostat a region of the hypothalamus and the thermostat responds by reducing the core body temperature what about humans professor clifford saper from the beth israel deaconess medical center says that if core body temperature is critical in extending the life spans of mammals one might wonder whether degc is indeed the optimal body temperature for humans and why evolution has not selected for a lower body temperature and longer life span but before we look at manipulating how long humans live he says one would certainly want to know the consequences of hypothermia before pursuing it as a way to increase life span could proposed new copyright laws restrict what you can get from a google search plugging a word or phrase into a search engine may soon give you fewer results if proposed new australian copyright laws are adopted according to internet giant google the laws could open the way for australian copyright owners to take action against search engines for caching and archiving material google says in a submission to a senate committee considering the legislation this could potentially limit the scope of the search engine results which the internet company describes as effectively condemning the australian public to the preinternet era earlier this year the federal government announced its proposed changes to copyright law which it says are designed to keep up with the rapidly changing digital landscape but in the submission to the senate legal and constitutional affairs committee senior counsel and head of public policy at google inc andrew mclaughlin says the changes fail to take into account the realities of the way in which information is processed and provided online google believes that the bill fails significantly to bring australias copyright act fully into the digital age the submission says the internet company wants general safety valve provisions as well as specific copyright exemptions to protect search engines from falling foul of the law given the vast size of the internet it is impossible for a search engine to contact personally each owner of a web page to determine whether the owner desires its web page to be searched indexed or cached google submits if such advance permission was required the internet would promptly grind to a halt google is also concerned about the effect of the copyright laws on digitisation projects like its book search which allows users to download books from the internet authors news organisations and porn sites dr matthew rimmer a copyright law expert from the australian national university says googles concerns are justified and that the current laws havent considered the crucial role search engines play in organising and providing information google has already attracted legal action from the french press agency afp as well as authors and publishers in the us he says the internet company is also appealing a decision which found in favour of a california pornographic companys breach of copyright claim against it rimmer says internet search engines could be crippled by the proposed copyright changes which protect libraries archives and research institutions but leave commercial entities like google out in the cold he says this will affect the ability of search engines to engage in digitisation projects like book search provide images index news stories and archive web content given the amount of litigation that google has been involved in the last year i think theyve got very genuine fears that they could be subject to copyright actions in australia he says he says rather than adopting the narrow fair use definitions contained in the legislation australia should adopt a usstyle openended fair use defence to ensure a flow of and access to information in the past when google has been sued one of the things it did is take down its links and content google could very well become more reluctant to provide such comprehensive image and news services and with geoidentification technology you can also offer certain content in some countries and not others a spokesperson for attorney general philip ruddock says the committee has received submissions including one from google and all would be taken into account when considering the legislation we will take on board all the submissions and the committee will take their views into account when they do their report he says submissions will be discussed at a public hearing in canberra today scientists hope they have a new way of tackling hivaids a bit like a trojan horse theyve engineered a faulty version of hiv infused it into the body and watched as it replicated harmless versions of itself an aids virus genetically engineered to fight other aids viruses has worked better than expected suppressing the virus and renewing the immune systems of a few patients researchers report the study involved just five people but the surprising results offer new hope both for the field of gene therapy and for treating the fatal and incurable aids virus but such an approach needs years more study the researchers caution the goal of this phase i trial was safety and feasibility and the results established that says dr carl june of the university of pennsylvania school of medicine who led the study but the results also hint at something much more he adds it seemed to have a vaccinelike effect in that the immune system was better in most of the patients than when they enrolled we are trying to study the mechanism hiv infects close to million people worldwide and has killed million a cocktail of drugs can help control infection but there is no cure and no vaccine the drugs can cause severe sideeffects in some patients and the virus can evolve resistance so that patients have to move to new drug combinations gene therapy is a promising but troubled field of research based on the premise that altering genes can cure disease it has cured only a few patients and some have developed leukaemia as a consequence one gene therapy volunteer died in junes team tried a new gene therapy approach first crippling the hiv virus they report today in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences the virus is gutted so that it only has half the size of the original or pathogenic virus june says antisense approach the socalled envelope gene remains and is reversed a manipulation called antisense the researchers then recruited five patients with hiv who were beginning to fail treatment their drugs no longer worked and the virus was beginning to damage their immune systems junes team removed the immune cells cd tcells that hiv attacks the researchers infected the cd cells in the lab with their newly engineered antisense hiv virus then infused them back onto the patients when hiv or any other virus infects a cell it injects its own genetic material into the cell the cell is turned into a virus factory sometimes pumping out thousands of copies of a virus before it explodes after the new antisense virus was infused newly infected cells pumped out defective virus june says the virus particles that are released are like sterile they are nonpathogenic june says safety first this test was meant only to show that the approach was safe and three years later none of the patients show ill effects the treatment appears to have helped restore the immune systems of four of the five patients and the virus remains partly suppressed we put back more cd cells than we took out we dont know if that is why their immune system gets better because there are more soldiers or whether it got better because of better antiviral effects june says the therapy is being developed by gaithersburg marylandbased virxsys corp and the studies are partly paid for by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases phase ii trials are under way in hiv patients who have disease wellcontrolled by drugs june says it is not yet clear if the treatment could work only in infected patients or might even be used as a preventive vaccine some day the aircrafts belly has been designed to improve lift plans for a new generation of silent aircraft designed to slash noise output while also cutting fuel consumption have been unveiled by uk and us aeronautics experts the singlewing aircraft would hold passengers and use less fuel than the current average say its creators who hope to have it flying commercially by the silent aircraft initiative sai has since gathered some researchers from the university of cambridge and the massachusetts institute of technology as well as an array of aeronauticslinked firms as well as cutting engine noise the designers focused on adapting the structure of the aircraft which is responsible for half of the noise a plane creates on landing to do this they created a single flying wing with the body of the aircraft also functioning to give lift this allows a slower approach which reduces noise as well as improving fuel efficiency at cruising altitudes the researchers say the new plane also does away with flaps a major source of noise while the undercarriage has been simplified and its aerodynamics improved the engines are mounted on the top of the aircraft to screen much noise from the ground some backers of the project admit to having had doubts at first about its viability my first reaction on hearing of the silent aircraft initiative was profound scepticism says dr john green of greener by design which promotes environmentallyfriendly air transport options three years on i have to concede that the sai has surpassed my expectations by quite a margin the team has produced a credible design that is predicted to meet the original target there are concerns that a merger between two sydney museums will eat up resources international researchers are so concerned about the proposed merger between the australian and powerhouse museums that they are urging the government to drop its plans in letters to new south wales arts minister bob debus obtained by abc science online they say a merger would jeopardise scientific research the government wants to bring both museums under one board and integrate them at a functional level according to a letter debus sent to the president of the australian museum trust brian sherman in august professor victor springer of the smithsonian institutes national museum of natural history says such a move could jeopardise the australian museums worldwide contribution to science i ask you with the most sincere and profound concern to ensure that neither the quantity nor the quality of the scientific research capacity at the australian museum suffers as a result of the proposed merger he says others including professor lee fuiman director of the university of texas marine science institute and senior curator at the royal ontario museum dr richard winterbottom have also appealed for the government to drop the merger plans it appears to me that if this merger were to proceed scientific research at the australian museum would be marginalised or might even disappear fuiman writes professor richard rosenblatt of the scripps institution of oceanography at the university of california san diego writes that he is concerned the proposed merger will result in a loss of scientific research capacity and positions australian scientists also concerned scientists from the university of sydney university of wollongong and the australian marine sciences association have also written to express concern as has a delegation of prominent members of the science community that is understood to have presented the government with a petition last week their concerns are understood to include the fact that the powerhouse and australian museums have a separate history manage different collections and have diverse research priorities in a letter to scientists debus says the government is doing a feasibility study to examine the benefits costs and issues associated with combining the boards of the two museums he says the need to protect their expertise is a paramount concern and that the government is taking a careful and considered approach to this matter but the public service association of new south wales which represents some of the staff at both museums has described the move as a costcutting exercise and fait accompli that will go ahead regardless of the outcome of the study director of the australian museum frank howarth was not available to comment scorpion fish and tiny vertebrates among research at the australian museum has been the discovery of a new species of scorpion fish in sydney harbour and what could be the worlds smallest vertebrate the stout infantfish schindleria brevipinguis in the great barrier reef a staff member at the australian museum speaking on the condition of anonymity says there are fears that research will be cut altogether or at least downgraded under an amalgamation the powerhouse museum doesnt have a scientific research component like we do and it would be easy to say this doesnt fit into the new model so lets get rid of research all together he says theres a school of thought that says this stuff should be at universities he says five of the museums designated research positions are vacant and are almost certain not to be renewed in the event of a merger staff have already begun looking elsewhere because of uncertainty about the museums future he says one scientist a world leader in his field is understood to have already accepted a job at the natural history museum in london report due dr des griffin who resigned in after years as director of the australian museum says the plan to bring the two bodies under a new single governing body will have little benefit for either the museums or the public he says all areas including scientific research social history and collection conservation are likely to be hit a steering committee consisting of departmental and museum representatives is due to report to the government on the amalgamation plan on november the report comes amid uncertainty about how the amalgamation will proceed when debus who recently announced his retirement quits parliament at the state election in march the solar flare was hundreds of thousands times more powerful than this one a typical solar flare from our sun seen in the ii pegasi flare was too distant to image in detail the most colossal xray flare ever detected has been caught in the act of zapping its solar system with planetkilling radiation the star is ii pegasi in the constellation pegasus about lightyears from earth that means the explosive flare seen by the nasa swift satellite designed to detect much more distant and powerful gammaray bursts took place around the year light from the event is only now reaching earth the xray flare is the firstever detected beyond our own sun that bears a striking resemblance to the much smaller xclass flares generated occasionally by our own sun its a hundred thousand times more powerful than the largest solar flares ever recorded says astronomer dr steven drake of nasas goddard space flight center despite being far more powerful it looks like it was created in the same way he says it starts with a tangle of magnetic field lines on the surface of a star that shortcircuits when that happens atomic particles are accelerated to speeds only seen on earth in hightech particle accelerators the accelerated particles can emit gamma rays which is what caught the swift satellites attention in the first place when the satellite turned to face ii pegasi it took aim with its xray detector and caught the hourlong eruption of xrays violent eruption the xrays were created as material violently erupted from the star and then arched back down and slammed back onto its surface by comparison xray flares on the sun last only second or minutes at most its certainly one of the biggest ever seen says drake about the ii pegasi flare its the handsdown winner in terms of those seen in soft xrays which are the rays just beyond the wavelength of extreme ultraviolet light drake is a coauthor on a paper on the flare that is being presented by the university of marylands dr rachel osten at a meeting in pasadena this week flaming star whats less surprising about the flare however is that it originated from ii pegasi says pennsylvania state university astrophysicist professor eric feigelson its known to be one of the most flaring stars says feigelson if he had been asked to guess which nearby stars were capable of belting out such a flare ii pegasi would have been among his top he says despite being a middleaged star that ought to be past this sort of wild and violent behaviour ii pegasi is part of a tightlybound twostar system in which the stars are roaring around each other generating powerful tidal forces that keep ii pegasi riled up fortunately our own sun is relatively quiet and stable with xray flares that are unable to penetrate earths atmosphere the bill lifts a ban on therapeutic cloning allowing the creation of human embryos for research australian scientists will not be allowed to use animal eggs to create embryonic stem cells under a bill passed by the senate this week for now this rules out creating hybrid humananimal cells for human disease research in australia despite this top stem cell researchers have welcomed the bill which lifts a ban on therapeutic cloning by allowing the creation of human embryos specifically for research the bill which will now go before the house of representatives allows a process called somatic cell nuclear transfer scnt this involves removing the nucleus from an egg and replacing it with one from a nonreproductive body cell of a patient for example to produce an embryo the same method used to produce dolly the sheep under the bill narrowly passed by two votes in the senate scnt embryos will not be implanted but used to produce embryonic stem cells and then destroyed after days the lockhart report late last year called for amendments to australian cloning law to allow therapeutic cloning using scnt and it recommended that both human and animal eggs be permitted for use in research but the bill passed this week rules out the use of an animal egg as a host for a human nucleus it comes at the same time that researchers in the uk are requesting permission to use cow eggs fused with human material for research on parkinsons stroke and alzheimers lockhart committee member professor loane skene from the university of melbourne says the committee recommended that animal eggs be used in research to reduce the demand on women for eggs its an invasive procedure for a woman to donate an egg and the eggs are very precious says skene so we thought it would be better to allow another source of eggs namely animal eggs to be used it was never envisaged that any stem cells that were produced from this would go into treatments for people bill welcomed despite animal egg ban despite the ban on animal eggs leading stem cell researchers have welcomed the bill professor bernie tuch of the university of new south wales in sydney says the decision is as momentous as the assassination of us president john f kennedy reason has prevailed says tuch who is quietly confident the bill will pass the house of representatives professor alan trounson of monash university in melbourne says the decision is consistent with public opinion show by surveys to be in favour of therapeutic cloning im very pleased he says but trounson says the decision to ban the use of animal eggs will limit research he says research using animal eggs helps understand the factors in cells that are responsible for reprogramming it to become pluripotent capable of turning into many other kinds of cells and he says the hope is that these factors could one day be identified and made synthetically thus eliminating the need for embryos altogether in stem cell research but he says thousands of eggs are required to sequence and identify the factors and there are just not enough human eggs for this you cant get thousands of human eggs to extract the factors he says tuch is less concerned about a shortage of eggs he says one possible source will be the women a year that have their ovaries removed because a genetic predisposition to ovarian cancer trading eggs trounson says eggs will be gathered internationally for research to find suitable embryonic stem cell lines a sociologist who studies the global trade in human and animal tissue peta cook of the queensland university of technology in brisbane says its this international context that needs to be considered when it comes to the pressures on women to sell their eggs while this is illegal in australia cook says there is a booming international trade in body parts if i need a kidney i can travel to pakistan or india and receive one from a live donor she says it is close to an ondemand system similarly women in eastern europe have had their eggs taken illicitly and sold by healthcare professionals says cook she says that in the us a woman can sell her eggs for up to us and this is very tempting to poor university students and such financial incentives can undermine informed consent and autonomous decisionmaking climate changes in greenland over the past years are reflected in antarctica scientists show they say the link is a conveyor belt of ocean currents that links north and south antarctica and greenland may be at opposite ends of the planet but their climate systems appear to be linked by a remarkable ocean current a study shows the results published today in the journal nature suggest that antarcticas ice could eventually start to melt because of localised warming in the far north atlantic the evidence comes from a metre ice core drilled by european scientists at dronning maud land on the part of antarctica that faces the south atlantic with its compacted layers of ice and telltale concentrations of methane in trapped air bubbles the core yields a picture of snowfall and atmospheric temperatures going back years even better than that it can be matched with cores of similar amplitude drilled in the greenland icesheet put together the cores provide the first solid evidence to back a theory that millennial scale climate changes that have unfolded in the far north and south of the atlantic are not isolated local events but linked the glacial climate in the northern atlantic can swing extraordinarily rapidly with temperatures rising by degc within the space of a few decades at the end of each ice age and falling back albeit more slowly when the next ice age beckons antarctica though has far smaller temperature shifts of between degc and these unfold over millennia but the two sets of ice cores point to what the european project for ice coring in antarctica scientists describe as a bipolar seesaw in short what happens at one end of the atlantic has a huge effect on the other although at different time scales and in different ways the cause appears to be a conveyorbelt system of ocean flows on the conveyor belt relative heat from the southern ocean around antarctica is picked up by a complex system called the meridional overturning circulation moc of which the gulf stream is the bestknown component the moc channels warm surface water up to the north atlantic coincidentally enabling countries in northwestern europe to have a balmy climate despite their northerly latitude when this warm water reaches the far north it cools and sinks and the moc sends it back south back down towards antarctica at depths far below the oceans surface our data shows that the degree of warming in the south is linearly related to the duration of cold periods in the north atlantic says lead author dr hubertus fischer of germanys alfred wegener institute for polar and marine research in bremerhaven understanding this link also sheds light on what the researchers say is a troubling aspect about humaninduced climate change the fate of antarctica where the worlds biggest store of frozen water is held today antarctica is still a reservoir of cold we dont see any contribution to global sealevel change because of antarctica its not melting yet in fact there has been more precipitation and some models suggest that antarctica actually will grow a little fischer says that reassuring scenario could change if as some studies are now tentatively suggesting the moc is beginning to falter says fischer the causes for this slowing of the atlantic conveyor belt could be a runoff of cold water from melting siberian permafrost or the greenland icesheet triggered by rising atmospheric temperatures but any disruption would lead to a buildup of warmer water off antarctica according to the conveyorbelt theory if the thermohaline ocean convection circulation in the atlantic slows down just a little it would cause a warming in the southern ocean fischer says and if you have warming around antarctica at a certain point the fringes of antarctica will even warm over the melting point then we could start to see melting at the borders and runoff and that would contribute to sealevel rise transplanted photoreceptor cell shown in green against a background of the hosts retina scientists have restored the sight of blind mice by transplanting lightsensitive cells into their eyes a new study shows the mice suffered from eye damage called photoreceptor loss which occurs in macular degeneration the leading cause of sight loss in the elderly and other eye disorders but instead of using stem cells which could form into any cell type the scientists transplanted cells that had reached a later stage of development towards becoming photoreceptor cells the international team publishes its results today in the journal nature we have shown for the first time that it is possible to transplant photoreceptors says lead author dr robert maclaren a scientist and eye surgeon at moorfields eye hospital in london these cells are lost in some of the more common causes of blindness he adds the scientists believe further research could lead to the first human retinal cell transplants for people with blinding diseases within a decade photoreceptors are specialised light sensitive cells that line the back of the eye and are essential for sight in eye diseases such as macular degeneration the cells are destroyed previous studies that had used stem cells master cells that have the potential to become any type of cell in the body had failed because the cells did not form into photoreceptors researchers had thought that the mature retina the part of the eye that senses light and forms images did not have the capacity for repair maclaren and his collaborators showed using precursor cells that are already programmed to become photoreceptors but are not quite there yet was the key to successful transplantation we have taken them out of the donor retina and transplanted them into a host retina extremely quickly at that precise point in time and with minimal trauma to the surrounding tissue maclaren explains the mice had eye diseases caused by genetic defects scientists have recently found cells on the margin of the retina in humans that have stemcell like properties and could potentially be grown in the lab to become photoreceptor precursor cells for treatment rather than focusing on stem cells we believed that if we could understand how cells develop and become photoreceptors our transplantation efforts would meet with greater success says professor anand swaroop of the university of michigan medical school and a coauthor of the study this technique gives us new insights in repairing damage to the retina and possibly other parts of the central nervous system he adds online searches can help doctors keep up to date with an increasing pool of medical research its not just patients who are frantically plugging their symptoms into google to see what disease they might have australian researchers say doctors are doing it too dr hangwi tang and dr jennifer ng of the princess alexandra hospital in brisbane report their findings today online in the british medical journal tang says the study was driven by personal curiosity after noticing how patients and doctors alike were using google to diagnose difficult cases in one example he had a patient whose father used the search engine to correctly diagnose that his son had the rare circulatory condition pagetvon schrtter syndrome tang and ng selected difficult cases presented in the new england journal of medicine including cushings syndrome creutzfeldtjakob disease encephalitis and cirrhosis they then plugged the symptoms of each case into the search engine to come up with a diagnosis when these diagnoses were compared with the correct published diagnoses the researchers found that google got it right of the time they say an online search is likely to be more effective at helping to diagnose conditions with unique symptoms that can be used as search terms tang says part of the challenge in using google is to be able to efficiently sift through the many pages of links that you get from an online search and he thinks that doctors are better placed than patients at doing this because they are better at selecting relevant links i dont think google can replace doctors in other words says tang millions of facts doctors have been estimated to carry two million facts in their heads to help them to diagnose disease the researchers say but search engines allow them to get quick access to an ever increasing medical knowledge base that might be impossible to hold in their head google in particular gives access to more than three billion articles they say with google scholar restricting searches to peer reviewed articles tang says while there are a number of other search engines that clinicians can use they often prefer google because it is so easy to use and freely available other studies professor johanna westbrook of the centre for health informatics in sydney says the findings are consistent with her own her team looked at how specialised search engines could help clinicians to both diagnose and treat patients using the best available evidence the study found clinicians were more likely to give the correct answers when they used online search engines interestingly though a few clinicians got the wrong answers using the search engines although they got the right answers without them westbrook says this underscores the importance of learning how to interpret complex evidence another interesting finding was that clinical nurse consultants using the search engines were just as accurate as doctors westbrook says this suggests search engines might help such nurses to diagnose and treat patients in rural areas where there are fewer doctors an online search engine is available hours a day she says whereas you cant get a clinician hours a day you cant get to a hospital library hours a day westbrook says that while google might be good for helping find information about diseases with unique symptoms more sophisticated search engines would be required for more complex diseases a gene type that governs brain size which may have had a neanderthal origin exists in modern humans neanderthals may have given the modern humans who replaced them a priceless gift a gene that helped them develop superior brains us researchers report and the only way they could have provided that gift would have been by interbreeding say the scientists their study published online in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences this week provides indirect evidence that modern homo sapiens and neanderthals interbred at some point when they lived side by side in europe finding evidence of mixing is not all that surprising but our study demonstrates the possibility that interbreeding contributed advantageous variants into the human gene pool that subsequently spread says professor bruce lahn a howard hughes medical institute researcher at the university of chicago who led the study scientists have been debating whether neanderthals who died out about years ago ever bred with modern h sapiens neanderthals are considered more primitive with robust bones but a smaller intellects than modern humans lahns team found a brain gene that appears to have entered the human lineage about million years ago it has a modern form or allele that appeared about years ago right before neanderthals became extinct the gene microcephalin mcph regulates brain size during development and has experienced positive selection in the lineage leading to homo sapiens the researchers write positive selection means the gene conferred some sort of advantage so that people who had it were more likely to have descendants than people who did not a common variant lahns team estimate that of all living humans have this type d variant of the gene by no means do these findings constitute definitive proof that a neanderthal was the source of the original copy of the d allele however our evidence shows that it is one of the best candidates lahn says the researchers reached their conclusions by doing a statistical analysis of the dna sequence of microcephalin which is known to play a role in regulating brain size in humans mutations in the human gene cause development of a much smaller brain a condition called microcephaly by tracking smaller more regular mutations the researchers looked at dnas genetic clock and dated the original genetic variant to years ago they note that this d allele is very common in europe where neanderthals lived and more rare in africa where they did not whats the advantage lahn says it is not yet clear what advantage the d allele gives the human brain the d alleles may not even change brain size they may only make the brain a bit more efficient if it indeed affects brain function he says now his team is looking for evidence of neanderthal origin for other human genes each of these spawning sea urchins share more than genes with humans scientists who have sequenced the genome of the sea urchin say these brainless and limbless invertebrates are surprisingly similar to humans they found that the california purple sea urchin strongylocentrotus purpuratus genome has genes and it shares of them with humans the genetic ties are far closer than scientists expect and make the sea urchin a closer genetic cousin of humans than the worm or fruit fly according to the study in todays issue of the journal science nobody wouldve predicted that sea urchins have such a robust gene set for visual perception says gary wessel a brown university biology professor and member of the sea urchin genome sequencing consortium ive been looking at these organisms for years and now i know they were looking back at me among other surprises from the project were that researchers found sea urchins have the most sophisticated innate immune system of any animal studied to date they say this may be one reason they live years or more sea urchins also carry genes associated with human diseases such as muscular dystrophy and huntingtons the creatures also have genes associated with taste smell hearing and balance the study found picture books help year olds learn about the world but are some books better than others toddlers can reenact what they see hear and learn from picture books new research shows the finding suggests that picture books may play a much greater role than simply entertaining toddlers and may help them understand the world researchers from the university of queensland and the university of virginia publish their findings in the latest issue of the journal developmental psychology researchers know that picture books can help year old preschoolers with a range of literary and life skills but it is harder to assess what year olds learn simply because they dont have the language skills to tell us so what we did in our study was to let toddlers show us what they know using a reenactment or imitation paradigm says australian author dr gabrielle simcock a postdoctoral fellow at the university of queensland researchers read toddlers a picture book that described how to make a toy rattle they then asked the toddlers to make a rattle using the objects supplied a green wooden ball a stick attached to a plastic lid and a clear plastic jar some children in each of three age groups months months and months were read either a picture book featuring colour photographs of a rattle being made a picture book with coloured pencil drawings of a rattle being made or not read a book at all overall children across all groups shown the colour photograph book were more successful in their attempts to make a rattle than those shown a colour drawing book or no book toddlers aged months and months did equally well with both versions of the book but the month toddlers shown the colour photograph book did much better than those shown the colour drawing book the month children needed the representation in the book to be highly realistic and to match very closely to the real world before they could understand while the older children were much more flexible in their ability to use the pictures the control group was least likely to be able to make the rattle simcock says the findings are exciting but dont mean that parents should only read their children only picture books with reallife photographs i think its through cumulative exposure to a wide range of different types of books and illustrations that children begin to abstract that the pictures in the books can represent real world things she says and not all books are informative about the real world often they might be animals talking and doing things simply to entertain the idea is you would be able to recharge your laptop without plugging it in you may one day be able to recharge your laptop or mobile phone without having to plug it into the wall says a us physicist but others say there are many hurdles before such transfer of energy means we can say goodbye to wires assistant professor marin soljacic of massachusetts institute of technology will present his teams work at the american institute of physics forum in san francisco this week todays wireless transfer of energy such as the transfer of light energy from the sun for solar power or the transfer of microwaves from transmitters for communication involve relatively low levels of energy but recharging devices like laptops requires a much higher level of energy and if this was routinely zapped through the air it could fry any living organisms that get in the way but soljacic says hes found a way of transmitting energy so that only the devices that it is recharging will pick it up so it will not affect humans instead of using traditional radiation he wants to use the part of the electromagnetic field that is nonradiative he says devices can be tuned to the frequency of this field and thus act as a sink for all the energy the transmitter gives out soljacic says this would prevent energy radiating out to areas it doesnt need to go to providing an efficient and safe method of wireless energy transfer the team calculates that an object the size of a laptop could be recharged within a few metres of the power source he says placing one source in each room could provide coverage throughout your home soljacic also thinks the technology could be used to power freely roaming robots in a factory finding a magic frequency but australian physicists yet to see the full details of soljacics work are sceptical of his claims they say the challenge is finding a magic frequency that doesnt also affect with living organisms and thus pose possible health risks you would be reintroducing all the problems that we went through with mobile phones says dr geoff anstis of the university of technology sydney referring to the uncertainty surrounding any longterm health effects of using mobiles and it wouldnt be until a couple of decades that you may be happy that there isnt a significant problem his colleague professor geoff smith agrees and says there are also technical challenges to keeping the devices tuned with the transmitters thus preventing the general release of stray energy i think this is nice physics but theres a way to go before it would be possible says smith he says any changes in the surrounding environment could detune the system and stop the safe and efficient transfer of power electrical engineer dr trevor bird of csiros ict centre says attempts so far to develop wireless power transfer have not been very successful he agrees that safety and technical barriers to wireless power systems are huge and would like further details on soljacics proposal bird also says that depending on the frequency of the field the antenna on the device being recharged may have to be very large eye of the storm saturn has cooked up a sizeable storm that scientists say is the first in the solar system besides earth to feature a hurricanelike eye and well formed towers of clouds the storm is smaller than the famed great red spot churning away on saturns giant neighbour jupiter but is still formidable it sprawls for about twothirds the diameter of earth across saturns southern pole it looks like a hurricane but it doesnt behave like a hurricane says dr andrew ingersoll a cassini scientist at the california institute of technology in pasadena the nasa cassini spacecraft spent three hours on october observing the beast and clocked its winds at kilometres per hour twice as strong as hurricane katrina at its peak the spacecraft also imaged a shadow cast by clouds stacked above and ringed around the south pole as well as two spiral arms of clouds protruding from the central ring scientists estimate the tower of clouds spans kilometres above the clouds in the centre thats between two and five times taller than the clouds that surround the eye of a hurricane on earth the saturn storm can grow much taller because the planets hydrogenhelium atmosphere is much less dense than earths at comparable pressures also unlike hurricanes on earth the storm is not moving around but appears locked at saturns south pole and with a temperature of around minus degc there is no ocean nor warm tropical water to pump its strength at the base of the eye scientists can discern but not explain dark clouds they do know saturns south pole is warmer than the rest of the planet the winds decrease with height and the atmosphere is sinking compressing and heating over the planets south pole says dr richard achterberg of nasas goddard spaceflight center additional observations are planned as the seasons change on saturn and the south pole transitions from summer to autumn whatever it is were going to focus on the eye of this storm and find out why its there ingersoll says dr richard helmer plays air guitar it could make an ideal christmas present in years to come australian scientists have built a tshirt that lets you play air guitar for real dr richard helmer and his csiro colleagues stitched wearable sensors into an ordinary long sleeved tshirt to create a prototype of what theyre calling a wearable instrument shirt simply by moving one arm to choose chords and the other to strum some imaginary strings home rockers wearing the shirt could make actual music the tunes come courtesy of a pair of small but resilient sensors placed in the elbows of the tshirt the sensors bend when you move your arm sending wireless signals to custom software that turns them into audio samples when you move your arm it bends a filament in the sensor which changes its resistance says helmer its a bit like a volume control one of the smart things about the technology is the sturdiness of the interface helmer says the materials can all stand up to ultraviolet light moisture and movement so working up a sweat is less likely to cause problems it allows you to jump around and the sound generated is just like an original mp he says the shirt is part of a wider csiro program on intelligent fabrics that aims to tackle more serious applications like health monitoring or d computer interfaces so why design an air guitar i thought we needed to do something that was a little less serious that people could have fun with helmer says in the meantime the researchers arent deaf to the possibility that their experiment could have commercial potential it depends on how much people want it helmer says the price might start out relatively high but over a year or two could drop down to christmas present level the researcher says at this stage noone knows exactly how much it might retail for but it would probably be in the hundreds of dollars helmer suggests a small price to pay perhaps for turning rock star fantasies into reality seabirds and migratory birds are early responders to changes in climate according to a new report nearly three quarters of all bird species in northeast australia and more than a third in europe could become extinct unless efforts to stop global warming are stepped up a report says up to of bird species in northeastern australia and of bird species in europe could disappear completely if the planets temperature continues to rise according to the international environmental group wwf this report finds certain bird groups such as seabirds and migratory birds to be early very sensitive responders to current levels of climate change says wwfs director of climate change policy hans verolme largescale bird extinctions may occur sooner than we thought he says in bird species and climate change the global status report released today on the sidelines of the un climate change conference in nairobi if high rates of extinction are to be avoided rapid and significant greenhouse gas emissions cuts must be made wwf says rising sea levels changes in vegetation and altered temperatures are among the effects of climate change linked to greenhouse gas emissions that impact negatively on bird species worldwide it says in the great plains of north america where up to of the continents ducks come to breed three quarters may face extinction because of adverse global warmingrelated changes to their habitat the report says while the effects would be most significant if the earths surface temperature rises degc above its preindustrial level it is currently degc above some birds are already feeling the heat the penguin population of the galapagos islands has decreased by half since the early s due to starvation and an inability to reproduce resulting from the effects of the el nintildeo climate pattern while migratory mountain island wetland artic antarctic and seabirds are all at high risk from climate change other species that are able to move easily to new habitats will not be as badly effected it says scientists also point out that existing conservation programs do not provide sufficient protection as bird species often shift into unprotected zones the report says psychologists says the secret of good batting is being able to anticipate the intent of the bowler the best batsmen can predict the sort of ball a bowlers going to deliver before it even leaves his hands a new study into the psychology of cricket shows less successful batsmen arent so highly attuned to subtle visual clues reports dr sean mller of rmit university in the latest issue of the quarterly journal of experimental psychology mllers study shows that a top batsman can predict how a ball will swing and where it will bounce well before its airborne experienced players can pick up cues that the intermediate and novice players dont or arent sensitive to he says a less skilled batsman can only make these judgements once the ball is in flight giving him less time to get in the right position time is critical as it can take just half a second from when the ball leaves the bowlers hand to it reaching the crease video simulations mller put members of the australian cricket team through a number of tests which were also repeated on intermediate and novice cricket players participants included former captain steve waugh and ricky ponting wholl skipper australia when it faces england in the first ashes test in brisbane next week in one test the subjects were shown a video of a bowler running up from the batsmans point of view the video was stopped at various stages of the runup and delivery and subjects were required to make a prediction about the ball based on this limited information they were also shown a video with various parts of the bowlers body blocked out for example with just a hand we occluded all of the bowler so youd see this little hand running in all the way from the start and then itll stop the screen will go black at the point of ball release he says experiments were also carried out on the field with batsmen wearing goggles that blacked out parts of the bowlers body inherent or learnt skill mller says it appears that movementrelated cuereading is subconscious because even the batsmen who were best at anticipating the bowlers intention couldnt specify why mller says while some people may be naturally more attuned to picking up visual cues its likely this can be taught and learned you need to be exposed to different types of bowlers different ways the ball spins in order to learn the relationship between a cue and what will actually happen he says it takes time to develop this skill and practice is needed can we improve batting his next study will look at whether videos and goggles can be used to refine predictive ability and improve batting if a player is going through a slump you could use this method to pick up if they need remedial work in picking up particular cues he says the study has other practical implications mller says honing our skills of predictive judgement can make us better drivers or help us cross roads more safely he says humans probably developed predictive judgement as an evolutionary skill to help avoid injury or attack mller was a phd student at the university of queensland when he conducted the research this false colour image reveals a large dust cloud in the globular cluster m in red the first time that dust has been seen there dawdling old stars and not just the spectacular explosions of massive supernovae may create much of the cosmic dust that builds generations of new stars and planets like our own say astronomers the nasa spitzer space telescope has spied loads of dust in what was expected to be a dustfree stellar cluster of old stars known as m in the distant pegasus cluster the surprising observations are pointing to a new way of looking at how the galactic starmaking factories work it also may help explain why theres so much more cosmic dust than can be accounted for by supernovae alone it was very surprising to see the dust there says chick woodward an astronomy professor at the university of minnesota woodward and graduate student martha boyer led a study of the dust which appears in the astrophysical journal in a sense its a very simple observation but one that had never been made so clearly before says astronomer professor christopher sneden of the university of texas at austin now there is no doubt that the dust is coming from the old stars that could help balance the galactic dust equation but before the researchers can even get to that they need to explain a more fundamental mystery of ms dust says woodward lots of dust according to the accepted theory cosmic dust needs to be seeded by heavier elements like silicon oxygen and carbon which tend to be products of bigger shortlived stars but ms big old stars are poor in heavy elements and theres still lots of dust how do we form dust when we dont have the metals around to condense them says woodward astronomers call all elements heavier than hydrogen and helium metals the fact that dust could be forming in space without metals could mean astronomers may have to revise their basic theories on where and out of what sort of dust newer stars and planets form as for how much dust there ultimately is in the galaxy for decades astronomers figured the dustiest places are where stars are forming as its cosmic dust that makes stars in the first place they also suspected that aged stars like those in m lose mass to space but had not witnessed it taking the form of dust until now one reason the dust from old stars has been elusive says woodward is that the stars are in clusters that formed at the same time as the milky way billion years ago thats an awful lot of time for the clusters to bob up and down like a dolphin through the galactic plane spring cleaning the cosmos on each pass the clusters probably get a good scouring a sort of spring clean in which the galactic wind clears away the dust the periodic cleaning helps explain why people havent seen it in the past says sneden of the dust around old stars one of the next steps says sneden will be to look for more cases like m just to make sure its not a fluke id like to know how common this is he says films not only depict environmental concerns they can contribute to them according to a new report scientists say hollywood is responsible for creating an unwanted special effect in the skies above los angeles pollution a study by the university of california los angeles ucla institute of the environment says the film industry is responsible for sending tonnes of pollutants into the atmosphere every year ozone and diesel emissions from trucks and generators used on movie sets as well as pyrotechnic explosions for special effects contribute to the layer of smog that hangs over los angeles many industries are moving toward more environmentally sustainable operations and its important that we monitor their progress says institute director and law professor mary nichols nichols says researchers note that although several studios and production companies are taking steps to minimise damage the industrys lack of a unified environmental strategy is a barrier to improvement two ucla professors who conducted an analysis as part of the study conclude that hollywood could be doing more the report says our overall impression is that with a few notable and inspiring exceptions environmental considerations are not high on the agenda in the film and television industry and that more could be done within the industry to foster environmentally friendly approaches the professors say the researchers cite the example of the makers of the day after tomorrow who paid for a us a package of environmental measures to offset damage caused by vehicles used in the blockbuster the makers of the last two matrix films were also praised for arranging for more than of set materials to be recycled the study found the problem is attributable to the transient nature of production companies the degree to which work is controlled by shortlived everchanging production companies makes it difficult to institutionalise best practices it says business groups warn against using the report to crack down on the film and television industry which generates around us billion a year in combined revenues and employs around people the protein soup that makes up semen can trigger serious allergic reactions in some women women can become allergic to their partners or other men according to new research presented this week at a us conference the culprit is semen reports dr david resnick acting director of the division of allergy at the new york presbyterian hospital his research is due to be presented at the annual meeting of the american college of allergy asthma and immunology in philadelphia it isnt sperm but its accompanying proteins that can cause an allergic response a phenomenon that allergy experts are recognising more often he says while there have been no reported deaths from an allergic response to semen some women may require hospitalisation after experiencing difficulty breathing hives and swelling less severe cases may result in itching burning and swelling after intercourse more women may have the reaction than are aware of it says resnick some women think theres another problem such as an infection or condom allergy resnick says but in one survey out of women who sought related information from a researcher approximately were determined to have a semen allergy sufferers resnick explains produce an antibody that recognises the proteins in a partners semen the antibody triggers a powerful immune response similar in mild cases to hay fever some women are only allergic to the semen of a certain partner but others react to multiple men other allergens can be transmitted through the seminal fluid these include medications such as penicillin and even some foods and beverages such as walnuts and soft drinks women with other allergies tend to be more prone to semen allergies what can we do about it two basic types of treatment are available the first is similar to standard allergy treatments that expose a sufferer to the allergen in diluted doses the second involves removing other proteins known to sometimes interfere with the desensitisation process from the semen plasma and then injecting a small amount of the processed semen at regular intervals in both cases frequent sexual contact is needed after the treatment we actually had one case where the male spouse was unable to engage in such frequent intercourse so his wife developed the allergy again says resnick jonathan bernstein a professor of medicine at the university of cincinnati and one of the worlds leading experts on semen allergies says he agrees with resnick but he believes that the processed semen though a more expensive treatment would be more effective bernstein also believes the allergy is probably underreported it may not be as rare as people think he says the allergy may go unrecognised yet it can have a significant effect on relationships comets may have caused giant tsunamis much more recently and much more frequently than anyone thinks enormous comets may have often bombarded our oceans causing tsunamis that dwarf ones seen today says a small group of scientists but most critics are yet to be convinced theres evidence to back claims about such recent frequent megaimpacts conventional wisdom has it that the earth suffers such violent hits from space only twice every million years but scientists including australian geomorphologist associate professor ted bryant of the university of wollongong have been studying what they say is evidence of massive objects slamming into the earths oceans as recently as years ago they say these kilometrewide objects are likely to have been comets and bryant says there have been up to such impacts in the past years based on research with others including assistant professor dallas abbott from the lamontdoherty earth observatory at columbia university bryant says these would have caused megatsunamis times bigger than the asian tsunami one of the largest earthquakegenerated tsunamis the world has ever seen aceh was a dimple compared to what were looking at says bryant who is associate dean of science at the university evidence from google earth bryant used satellite images from google earth to identify inland dunes in the shape of arrowheads that he says are signs of megatsunamis the tsunamis would have displaced marine deposits containing marine fossils he says dumping them inland as chevron dunes weve found that chevrons are everywhere everywhere around the worlds coasts he says abbot used sea surface altimetry which measures the height of the sea surface to get an image of the seabed to identify possible underwater craters which could be evidence of the impact that caused the tsunamis bryant says abbot also looked for melted material in cores from the seabed around the craters to confirm impacts caused them the chevrons and craters were linked by the direction the chevrons were pointing for example two chevrons identified kilometres inland from the gulf of carpentaria in australia both pointed north in the direction of two craters found in the gulf of carpentaria itself says bryant dating of sediments to the north of the craters suggests the impact happened years ago he says and the wellpreserved chevrons also date to around the same time indian ocean crater bryant says chevrons about years old around the indian ocean are associated with a kilometre wide impact crater located thousands of kilometres to the southeast of madagascar there are chevrons around the indian ocean that all point back to this one crater site he says and he says this is supported by evidence from an anthropologist on the team who found myths and legends from the area dating back about years referring to an event that could have been the impact bryant says other evidence of a megatsunami as recently as years ago has been found on the eastern coast of australia he and abbott have linked this one to an impact crater south of stewart island in new zealand none of the research has been published but some of it will be presented at an american geophysical union meeting in san francisco next month mixed reception earth scientist professor richard arculus of the australian national university says he accepts bryants evidence of megatsunamis but he says working out what caused them and when will require more evidence his colleague marine sediment specialist dr bradley opdyke is also not yet convinced theyre heading in the right direction he says but believes more evidence is required to prove the existence of the indian ocean crater new zealandbased tsunami expert dr mauri mcsaveney of gns science says there is pretty good evidence that there are more large craters on our planet than mainstream scientists think there should be while he says bryants claims are perfectly plausible and the best available evidence suggests the new zealand crater is one from the holocene period this could still be wrong he has yet to convince me and a lot of others says mcsaveney but as arculus says bryant is fighting against a tradition in earth sciences that suggests everything we see around us is the product of slow processes rather than sudden catastrophic events geologists are naturally anticatastrophe he says were inclined to be conservative size matters say researchers who are urging more scrutiny of nanotechnology urgent research into the potential dangers of nanotechnology needs to be carried to convince the public of its future value in fields such as medicine and computing scientists urge they believe the potential of nanotechnology which operates on an atomsized scale will not be realised without clear information about the true risks and how to avoid them dr andrew maynard of the woodrow wilson international center for scholars in washington and other international experts warn that time is running out to get it right if the public loses confidence in the commitment of governments business and the science community to conduct sound and systematic research into possible risks then the enormous potential of nanotechnology will be squandered we cannot let that happen they say in a commentary in the journal nature nanotechnology is the design and use of particles as small as onebillionth of a metre a human hair is about nanometres across it is already being used in cosmetics computer chips sunscreens selfcleaning windows and stainresistant clothing but materials on such a small scale can have different properties to larger versions the experts say instruments to assess environmental exposure to nanomaterials must be developed in the next three to years and that methods are needed within the next years to evaluate the toxicity of nanomaterials they also stress the need to develop models within a decade to predict the potential impact of new nanomaterials on health and the environment and strategic programmes for riskfocused research over the next months it is about whether governments industry and scientists around the world are willing to make safe nanotechnology a priority they add analysis of neanderthal dna shows they rarely interbred with our ancestors as some scientists have suggested researchers have sequenced dna from the leg bone of a neanderthal man who died years ago and say it shows the neanderthals are truly distant relatives of modern humans who interbred rarely if at all with our own immediate ancestors they estimate that modern humans and neanderthals split from a common ancestor at least years ago and possibly years ago although we share of our dna we see no evidence of mixing years ago in europe we dont exclude it but see no evidence says dr edward rubin of the us department of energy joint genome institute in walnut creek california who led one study this conflicts with some evidence from other researchers including a team who said earlier this month that humans may have inherited a brain gene from neanderthals the researchers reported their findings jointly in the journals nature and science rubins team used one method to isolate and sequence part of the neanderthals dna another team led by professor svante paabo of the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology leipzig germany used a separate method to sequence a much larger amount paabo was the first scientist to find and sequence neanderthal dna in and first suggested that neanderthals did not mix with modern humans i think the sequence data will serve as a dna time machine that will tell us about biology and aspects that we will never be able to get from their bones and a limited number of associated artefacts rubin says neanderthals and modern humans are both descended from homo erectus which left africa and spread around the world about million years ago living side by side neanderthals lived in europe and the middle east until about years ago cromagnon people the ancestors of modern humans started a second wave of migration out of africa about years earlier one huge question is how closely they interacted paabos and rubins genetic analysis both suggest there was little sexual contact at least according to the genes from this one male found at the back of a cave in croatia paabos team sorted through neanderthal specimens before they found a bone wellpreserved enough to provide dna they took the tiniest samples they could to preserve the valuable bones they know it was a male because the dna has the telltale y chromosome paabos team says it hopes to have a complete genetic sequence within two years they say the neanderthal sequences are identical to human dna sequences this compares to about a similarity between humans and chimpanzees who split from a common ancestor to million years ago threeway comparisons among the human chimpanzee and neanderthal genomes should shed light on what makes modern humans unique experts agree rubin and other experts stress that while full sequences of the human genome are available very little is understood about what the code actually means we have the book but we havent yet read it rubin says the researchers found for instance sequences linked with eye colour but cannot read the code to tell what colour neanderthal eyes were the robot can adapt to changes in both terrain and itself walking on three legs for example if the fourth is lost a starshaped robot that senses and responds to changes in the environment and damage to its own body has been developed by us researchers because the robot continually refines its builtin software to move efficiently wherever it is and whatever its condition it could help shape the future of mobile robotics the fourlegged starfish robot is reported by dr josh bongard and team from cornell university in todays issue of the journal science the robot can adapt to changes in both terrain and itself walking on three legs for example if the fourth is lost the starfish could lead the way for a new generation of autonomous robots that can quickly adjust to unpredictable environments and circumstances much the same way people and other animals do the technology is very powerful says professor dario floreano director of the institute of systems engineering in lausanne switzerland its a major advance in the field says floreano who is not associated with the research the software in conventional robots typically doesnt account for unpredictable changes in the environment or to the robot itself that could restrict its movement but the starfish can explore its own abilities and limitations taking them into account before planning a move robot sensing the robot begins by getting a sense of itself testing each of its joints with random motions sensors on the joints capture each joints range of motion and feed that information to the mathematical models built into its controlling software each model figures out one possible mode of locomotion for example one model might find how the robot is capable of scurrying scorpionlike on three legs using the fourth like a tail for balance another might offer a way for the robot to scuttle sideways like a crab every model may be accurate on some level but not all are efficient to refine the results a computer program searches through the models looking for areas of disagreement among their results this is the key element of the entire process says team member dr hod lipson director of the computational synthesis laboratory at cornell university the most common disagreements represent the biggest flaws he says to work out potential kinks in those areas the robot performs each possible motion where the models disagree feeding more data about the efficiency of each option back to models the cycle is repeated times and in the end the last model standing is the one that instructs the robot where to go and how challenges ahead at the moment all of the computations are run on a desktop computer if the robot is to work autonomously it will need that computing power onboard that could be a potential challenge says floreano especially if the robot is equipped with many sensors but he feels certain that the cornell team has a solution and expressed confidence in the flexibility of the approach which can be applied to any type of robot many people have protested over the use of animals in experiments the use of lab animals to develop new medicines cosmetics and pesticides could be eliminated by virtual experiments on computer say european researchers the virtual tests could be run using computer models that draw on a vast database of information about chemical compounds and the system could also help develop new compounds in record time the researchers say developing new chemical compounds consists of multiple steps from identifying an active chemical among millions of potential leads to pinpointing a target finding an effective chemical requires a lot of mixing and matching of compounds in the lab but access to a centralised database of chemical candidates under development known as chemomentum could help researchers save some lab time and lab animals modelling tools available in the software could be used to optimise the chemical structure of the compound and analyse whether those changes make it interact better or worse with a potential target once the right chemical compound is pinpointed it needs to be tested for effectiveness as well as toxicity classic toxicity tests are done by exposing animals to increasing doses of a chemical at a low dose no effect is seen at a high dose all animals die the right dose is somewhere in between based on such animal tests the lethal dose of a chemical is extrapolated to humans according to the british union for the abolition of vivisection million animals are used in laboratories to tests range of goods including household products cosmetics food additives pharmaceuticals and industrial and agricultural chemicals to name a few mathilde romberg a research fellow at the university of ulster in the uk and one of the principal investigators on the chemomentum project hopes the new system can reduce those numbers romberg has partnered with experts at eight universities institutes and companies from france germany italy estonia and switzerland to compile the system she says the userfriendly program should help the chemical industry and european regulatory bodies evaluate the substances and assess related risks with fewer and fewer animal tests in theory experimental tests may not be necessary with chemomentum rather users would input information about the leads and targets they are interested in and the system would return the corresponding toxicity predictions the software will be designed to perform calculations using standard pcs or draw upon the computing power of pc clusters also known as grid computing to crunch more complex data expeditiously at the moment the models that predict toxicity are new and people are sceptical about using them said paolo mazzatorta a scientist in the chemical food safety group at nestleacute research center in lausanne switzerland but experimental tests are expensive and that could eventually drive more interest in predictive modelling i think there will come a moment when this science will be more mature and it will be used he says researchers are trying to find out more about paranormal experiences an international online survey of paranormal experiences has met with an overwhelming response say australian researchers the survey on phenomena that cannot be explained using the current laws of science is by researchers at monash university in melbourne the paranormal is covered by the media everyday it is also in the public domain via chatrooms and websites and email lists says rosemary breen who will use the survey results as part of a masters degree i wanted to tap into this and give a scholarly voice to these experiences a recent gallup poll revealed that of americans hold at least one paranormal belief and a uk newspaper poll showed that of britons accept the existence of the paranormal say the researchers but little is known about contemporary spontaneous experiences and official surveys are rare they say breen says the survey is not about beliefs or whether parapsychological phenomena exist rather it is about what people have experienced and the impact it has had on their lives and she says she is not aware of any equivalent study in the world thousands of responses some people have made contact via the internet since the survey began six weeks ago says dr beverley jane who is supervising breens research she says of respondents claim to have had at least one brush with the paranormal the exercise seeks to gauge the frequency effect and age of onset of unexplained phenomena such as premonitions outofbody and neardeath episodes telepathy and apparitions results to date showed of respondents believe an unexplained event changed their lives mostly in a positive way some also claim to have seen heard or been touched by animal or person that wasnt there report having had a premonition and almost recalled a previous life the respondents are sincere and they want to report what they have experienced jane says she is amazed by the strong response on such a sensitive subject and put this down to the virtual nature of the study people can do it in the privacy of their homes instead of in front of the researcher so they can answer honestly she says while the survey was anonymous some people later sent emails with their contact details jane says she says the study is not seeking to assess respondents mental health but says it does offer people the chance to tell somebody about experiences they would normally keep to themselves due to the overwhelming response to the survey the researchers expect to extend the closing date for responses past its initial november deadline massage may make baby happier but the evidence to date suggests it wont improve physical or emotional development a gentle massage appears to lower levels of stress hormones in unsettled babies but theres no evidence that infant massage has any benefit on growth or development a scientific analysis shows infant massage has long been used in many asian and african cultures to ease colic and crying help babies sleep and even aid their growth and development there has also been growing interest in infant massage among parents in western countries uk researchers seeking to assess the science behind the practice analysed clinical trials they report their findings in the latest issue of the cochrane library a publication of the cochrane collaboration an international organisation that evaluates medical research the trials involved infants aged six months and under who were randomly assigned to receive massage or not the researchers found that across nine of the studies gentle massage appeared to improve infants sleep patterns ease crying and strengthen motherchild bonding some studies found that massage reduced babies levels of the stress hormones norepinephrine and epinephrine and appeared to release melatonin which is associated with sleep patterns given this apparent hormonal effect its not surprising that massage seemed to improve sleep and crying according to the researchers led by dr angela underdown of the university of warwick in coventry england tentative support but the nine studies failed to come up with any evidence of cognitive or behavioural benefits there is no evidence of any impact on infant attachment temperament psychomotor or mental development the researchers say overall the results offer tentative support for teaching parents and caregivers infant massage the investigators conclude but they say there isnt enough evidence to universally recommend the practice the trials included in the review were conducted in china north america great britain and israel and included healthy fullterm infants in some studies researchers provided the massage while parents did in others most looked at the effects of daily massage over a period of weeks the researchers said of the trials they looked at were not entirely reliable because of concerns about their methodology for example some lacked information about how the study was designed and conducted meaning more quality research is needed its also unclear how often when or for how long babies should receive massage to get the most benefits underdown and colleagues recommend that future studies examine these questions new research suggests that whale communication is even more sophisticated than previously thought whales have such a broad vocal repertoire that they can call to their young woo potential mates and even express emotions according to researchers who have identified social sounds in humpback whales their work will be presented at the upcoming joint meetings of the acoustical society of america and the acoustical society of japan in hawaii social sounds are brief unpatterned noises that are distinct from lengthier complex whale songs the new research adds to a growing body of evidence that whales convey more meaning through vocalisations than previously thought i wouldnt say whales possess language as thats a human term says dr rebecca dunlop a researcher in the school of veterinary sciences at the university of queensland who worked on the study whales dont string these sounds together like words and form sentences its more like a simple vocabulary she says the scientists visually tracked pods of whales migrating along the east coast of australia the researchers used a static hydrophone array sensitive equipment that detects sound waves linking the whale sounds to various activities and contexts wops thwops and yaps they identified distinct sounds which fell into basic types these include wops made by females thwops made by males yaps made when pods split and high pitched cries that appeared to express anger in addition to vocalisations the researchers found that whales send messages through body language by breaching the surface slapping water with their tails and blowing underwater bubbles famous for their long complex songs whales also sometimes speak short song units individually instead of singing them males especially seem to do this when trying to woo a female song is a loud broadcast signal and two singers singing at the same time is bound to be confusing to the receiver dunlop says if hes trying to attract a female but doesnt want his signal confused with another singer in the area then using song units in this case might be the way forward she thinks one reason whales are so vocal is because sound travels better in water than light and so sight is less useful to whales than hearing human interference dr christopher clark director of the bioacoustics research program at cornell university conducted a similar study on right whales he says that just as researchers are gaining a better understanding of whale vocalisations humans are creating so much ocean noise through shipping oil and gas exploration recreational traffic and more that we often prevent whales from communicating many whales have very traditional feeding grounds and their migratory routes occur along shallow coastlines which are now some of the noisiest most heavily impacted habitats he says the ocean area over which a whale can communicate and listen today has shriveled down to a small fraction of what it was less than a century ago scientists say they can genetically engineer cotton plants to remove a toxic compound making cottonseed fit for humans to eat scientists say they have found a way of using the cotton plant to feed potentially half a billion people a year texas am university plant biotechnologist associate professor keerti rathore and colleagues report they have genetically altered the plant to reduce the levels of the toxic chemical gossypol in cottonseed making it fit for humans to eat it actually tastes pretty good it reminds me of chickpea its a fairly goodtasting seed he says it tasted better than soybean i can tell you that adds rathore who publishes the teams research in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences the proteinrich gm cottonseed could be ground into a flour and made into bread and other foods he says rathore and his team turned to a technique also being used in cancer and aids research they used socalled rnai or rna interference technology that can silence a gene to cut the amount of gossypol in the cottonseed when humans eat gossypol it can damage their heart and liver the researchers left gossypol intact in the rest of the plant because it guards against insects and disease so the trick is not to affect the levels of these compounds in the rest of the plant but eliminate it from the seed only and thats what we have done rathore says this cottonseed could serve as a highprotein food for the worlds hungry and falls well within the criteria set by the world health organization and us food and drug administration for food consumption the researchers say potentially if all of the cottonseed today which is produced can be utilised for human nutrition directly it can meet the protein requirements of million people on an annual basis rathore says wasted protein that is a lot of protein right now really being wasted he adds noting that cottonseed often is fed to cattle because bacteria in their stomachs can break down gossypol the chemical is present naturally within the glands in the aboveground parts of the cotton plant for millennia people have spun cotton fibres into clothing and other fabrics but for each kilogram of cotton fibre the plant produces kilograms of seed rathore says cotton is grown in more than countries worldwide with the exception of the us and australia he says it is grown primarily in developing countries researchers estimate that it will take at least another decade to develop cotton varieties with these qualities for broad commercial production in the s and s agricultural scientists bred cotton varieties that had no gossypol glands but they were a commercial flop because the absence of the toxin made the plants too vulnerable to insects and disease in addition to edible cottonseed the rnai technique might be applied to other crops with toxic components such as fava beans to increase their use the researchers say firefighters face longterm health risks new research shows firefighters appear to have higherthanaverage rates of cancer the largest study of its kind shows the analysis of previous studies shows that firefighters are at greater risk of prostate and testicular cancers as well as the immune system cancers nonhodgkins lymphoma and multiple myeloma eight additional cancers show possible links to the job according to findings published in the journal of occupational and environmental medicine firefighters are exposed to many potentially cancercausing chemicals released from burning materials though they wear breathing apparatus and other protective equipment while fighting fires researchers point out they typically remove the gear when theyre merely in the vicinity of the fire at the scene of the fire toxic substances such as benzene lead uranium and asbestos can be inhaled or absorbed through the skin and at the fire station idling trucks expose firefighters to diesel exhaust the cancer risks seen in this latest study suggest that firefighters need better onthejob protection according to the study authors firefighters work in an inherently dangerous occupation on a daily basis says lead author dr grace lemasters of the university of cincinnati college of medicine she and her colleagues based their findings on an analysis of international studies that included more than firefighters in all across the studies firefighters had double the risk of testicular cancer as men in other occupations a higher risk of both multiple myeloma and nonhodgkins lymphoma and a higher risk of prostate cancer these findings raise red flags lemasters and her colleagues write and point to a need for innovative comfortable protective equipment allowing firefighters to do their job without compromising their health another more immediate measure would be for firefighters to shower as soon as they return to the fire station the researchers say other investigators they note have found that firefighters often say their skin ends up covered in soot after battling a blaze male chimps fight over older females who are seen as a prize catch chimpanzee males prefer to have sex with older females according to us researchers showing one of the biggest behavioural differences between humans and our closest biological relatives male chimps will chase down and fight over the oldest females meanwhile the youngest female chimps are forced to beg for masculine attention say anthropologist assistant professor martin muller and colleagues at boston university its really dramatic because its not just that the old chimps are avoiding the youngest adult females they actually have a strong preference for the older mothers muller says writing in the journal current biology muller and colleagues say they studied chimpanzees living in the kanyawara community of kibale national park in uganda it is easy to observe their mating behaviour chimpanzee copulations are frequently preceded by a series of male courtship signals eg glancing with erect penis and branch shaking after which either the male or the female approaches the other to mate the researchers write they also collected the chimps urine to test for various hormones that demonstrate fertility the researchers were checking to see if chimpanzees behave like humans their closest living relatives who form longterm mating bonds and who value younger females this is most definitely not the case with chimps the very oldest adult females were the most sought after the males fight over them more muller says they dont have to do anything to get the males interested the males find them they follow them around if you look at the very youngest females the males will mate with them but it does take more work on the females part showing off also unlike humans female chimpanzees actively advertise when they are fertile with bright red swellings around the genital area and unlike human females chimpanzees apparently remain fertile their entire lives although these wild ugandan chimpanzees rarely lived beyond the age of muller says that older female chimpanzees are more dominant socially and have access to better food the females that have access to the most food are the most fecund the most likely to conceive in any cycle he says and males may know that older females may also be better mothers the researchers guess the males do end up mating with all the females for the most part muller notes but he says the study challenges common conceptions normally i think peoples default assumption is well other animals they must also find young females attractive muller says and people assume that young females are more fertile than older females but female chimpanzees do not experience the rapid decline in fertility that is seen in human females after their s what happens to tissue thats removed during a biopsy and stored in liquid nitrogen some australians are concerned that tissue samples held by hospitals could be used to make human clones a survey of public attitudes towards tissue banking reveals early findings from the study by researchers from the centre for values ethics and the law in medicine at the university of sydney show some people are also opposed to biopsy tissue such as cutout tumours being used as a source of stem cells or by drug companies most hospitals have a collection of tissue thats been removed for diagnosis and serves as a research resource the tissue can be used for inhouse research or passed on to other institutions and private companies but the laws relating to stored tissue are confusing and contradictory because of differences between state and federal jurisdictions says bronwen morrell who will present the studys interim findings at the australian health and medical research congress in melbourne this week she says her study indicates that people want laws setting down basic parameters about consent information about the type of research and whether their tissue can be used for profit morrell asked participants a range of questions including whether there was any sort of research they wouldnt want their tissue used for two things that came up repeatedly were cloning and stem cells she says cloning came up repeatedly which is interesting because i think they were thinking of reproductive cloning which isnt allowed in australia anyway but obviously thats something thats very much on their mind the federal government is currently debating recommendations of the lockhart review to allow therapeutic cloning in australia but reproductive cloning remains banned morrell says the study also shows some people trust the public sector more with their tissue than private companies as long as research was being done in a public hospital they would feel comfortable with that she says but if it was a private company doing the research especially drug companies they wouldnt be that happy some people also wanted any profit made out of their tissue to go back into research she says dr wendy lipworth who was involved in the research says that genetic technology has raised new issues for tissue banks i think or years ago nobody would have thought anything of it they would have thought why would i care its just the leftover bits of my tumour she says but as genetic technology has evolved you can find out more and do more with that material there wasnt as much at stake until recently recommendations the current survey is part of a threepart study into in the ethics of tumour banking the first part of the study published in the journal of law and medicine this year surveyed hospitals and private research institutions the second part which questioned experts and medical professionals is still being analysed the third and final part subjected people including patients parents consumer representatives and health advocates to a indepth one hour interview morrell says researchers hope to publish a series of reports when the results are fully analysed the researchers may also make recommendations about the sorts of procedures that tissue banks should follow worrell says scientists say they havent heard from the mars global surveyor in weeks nasa scientists conceded that the yearold mars global surveyor is probably lost in space after the us agency tried unsuccessfully for two weeks to make contact the spacecraft the oldest of five nasa robotic explorers studying mars was circling the planet snapping highresolution images and studying the climate it was on a mission that led to the first evidence that water once flowed on the planets surface the probe went silent after reporting problems with a sticky solar panel and scans of the skies have produced no sign of it mars global surveyor was a fantastic mission it has really revolutionised how we look at mars says dr fuk li mars exploration program manager we havent given up hope but we are all ready to celebrate a long life and a job well done one chance remained this week to recover the probe which has been programmed to transmit a signal to nasas robotic geology station opportunity located near mars equator opportunity will relay any signal from the orbiter to earth during passes this week via the mars odyssey if mars global surveyor is in the sky and its transmitter is on then opportunity should receive it says dr john callas project manager for the mars exploration rover mission scientists at nasas jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena california lost contact with the spacecraft on november after it signalled it was having trouble moving one of its solar panels to track the sun as it emerged from behind mars the spacecraft is programmed to position itself so that a stuck panel faces the sun but that orientation could block its communication with mission controllers says tom thorpe the mars global surveyor project manager power problem if mars global surveyor is turned away from the sun for more than a few orbits it could be low on power an outcome that seemed to be supported by the spacecrafts apparent failure to respond to commands that would raise its transmitter thorpe says we dont believe the solar panel is in any way degraded the problem seems to be the gimble motor that is sticking thorpe says why we cant raise the transmitter could be a function of the power problem mission scientists first hailed the orbiter via the deep space network receiving what they believed was a weak carrier signal from the probe two or three days into the search then it went silent they then turned to the newly arrived mars reconnaissance orbiter which used its onboard cameras during recent passes near mars global surveyors last known orbit but that probe had no definitive sightings of its sister craft if opportunity records no sign of mars global surveyor scientists say they will have exhausted the most likely possibilities for contacting it the year mission which was extended four times cost a relatively modest us million a million mars global surveyors cameras were the first to record topographic features suggesting flowing water on mars and its magnometer found the remains of magnetic fields that once shielded mars surface from deadly cosmic rays its mineral mapping helped scientists choose landing sites for opportunity and its twin spirit and will be used to evaluate landing sites for the nextgeneration of mars surface probes the phoenix and the mars science laboratory tall men have the advantage when it comes to speeddating if you want to be a big hit at speeddating walk tall say uk scientists their survey found that taller men are more likely to get a date the university of essex scientists calculated that for every centimetres taller a man is than his speeddating rivals the number of women who want to meet him goes up by about dr michele belot and dr marco francesconi analysed the choices made by men and women at speeddating events they found that women prefer men who are young and tall while men are more attracted to women who are young and thin what we try to show is that there is a pattern in how people choose each other says belot but she readily concedes that science does not have the answer to all affairs of the heart it is true we can explain quite a lot but there is still a part that is unexplained that is where love will play a role she says but in the unforgiving numbers game of love age is crucial each extra year in comparison with others in the speeddating group reduces a mans chance of finding a partner by for women it is and it is often all about the luck of the draw on the big night should a man of average height turn up at the speeddating event all is not lost if all his male rivals are short then women may decide that he does measure up after all we also found that an overweight woman is less likely to receive a proposal from men men on the other hand do not seem to be penalised for being overweight belot says the survey also explodes the myth that blondes have more fun hair colour was not a major issue when speeddating and when the big night was over women were much pickier than men choosing only men as possible future dates to add insult to injury almost half of the women said they did not want to see any of the men again green turtle returning to the sea after laying a clutch of eggs on the beach at enu island in indonesia scientists have conducted the first genetic census of endangered green turtles throughout southeast asia and australia providing a conservation tool the green turtle is on the red list of endangered species internationally so we wanted to be able to identify if there were particular groups that might need specific conservation efforts says phd student kiki dethmers from the university of queensland her work on the turtle chelonia mydas appears in the november issue of the journal molecular ecology turtle populations are shrinking for a range of reasons she says some are hunted for food others are accidentally caught in fishing nets while others still are affected by a loss of habitat or viral diseases dethmers and her colleagues gathered skin or blood samples from turtles nesting at different sites in malaysia the philippines micronesia indonesia papua new guinea and australia from each sample they extracted a mitochondrial dna genetic material that is passed down from mother to child mitochondrial dna is inherited through the female line and females come to the beaches to nest so our study was based on sampling the female population dethmers says the results show that there are just distinct genetic groups within the region some groups were made up of a single nesting beach but in other cases nesting sites in different locations turn out to be genetically related some of the groups were substantial such as the related turtles that nest on western australias northwest shelf others like some groups in malaysia might contain just a few hundred turtles the information dethmers and her colleagues have gathered could be vital for future conservation efforts the turtles situation varies from one area to another she says our data would be useful for example if one of the groups is particularly threatened because it would give you an idea of how many turtles are being affected this can help you make predictions about whether that is going to make a certain population go extinct cooling towers are one option for getting rid of waste heat from power plants any australian nuclear power plants would most likely need to be built on the coast where gigalitres of seawater could be used to cool them suggest experts because weve got a water shortage in this country it would be best to place them on the coast says nuclear power engineer professor john price of monash university in melbourne prices comments come in the wake of a draft report from prime minister john howards nuclear taskforce that proposes constructing nuclear power plants to meet australias future energy needs price who welcomes the new report says gigantic amounts of water are required to cool a nuclear power station im talking about tonnes per second says price who has designed nuclear power stations in the uk according to the taskforce headed by nuclear physicist dr ziggy switkowski nuclear power plants are less efficient than coalfired plants and thus require more cooling one estimate from a recent report to the queensland government suggests a megawatt nuclear power station would use around gigalitres of water a year this is about times the water used by an equivalent coalfired power station says the report by dr ian rose of roam consulting a queenslandbased company with expertise in energy modelling water cooling while the switkowski report does not consider specific locations for nuclear power plants in australia it says they are often located near existing power stations because this ensures ready access to appropriate infrastructure and water for cooling most nuclear power stations are cooled using water from a river lake or the ocean the report says but the rose report says a lack of reliable river water makes a nuclear power station cooled by river water not an option for australian conditions both rose and price also raise the issue of environmental effects of the warmer water discharged from nuclear power stations on rivers i wouldnt think that would be a good idea siting a nuclear power station on a river in australia because the river volumes are not huge and you dont want to heat the river up says price price suggests power stations by the sea are preferable because the sea can more easily dilute the heat of the discharge but rose says it may be difficult to find suitable seaside locations the number of seaboard nuclear sites in areas close to a major transmission grid in eastern australia is likely to be limited his report says the us environmental protection agency says that discharge from nuclear power stations can also contain heavy metals and salts that can harm aquatic life it also says removal of water upstream in the first place can also damage river environments cooling options instead of discharging warm water some nuclear power stations evaporate water into the air through cooling towers price says while rose says this is a preferred option price says this is a waste of water according to the switkowski and rose reports it is also possible to use dry cooling which reduces water consumption by using air as a coolant but they say this would be more expensive another option says price is to use waste heat from nuclear power stations to desalinate water that may be one of the most interesting outputs as far as australia is concerned he says the nuclear taskforce is inviting public submissions on its draft report until december and the final report is due at the end of the year lefthanded people seem to have better connections between the left and right halves of their brain so does this mean they are better at complex tasks like gaming lefthanded people often perform better than righthanders at fast or difficult tasks that involve lots of information or stimuli new research suggests for instance lefthanders might be better at playing fast computer games talking while driving in heavy traffic and piloting a jet fighter activities that need both hemispheres of the brain to process information research shows that the left and right hemispheres communicate and work together better in lefthanders as information transfers from one to the other slightly faster and perhaps more efficiently dr nick cherbuin from the australian national university and colleagues report their findings in the november issue of the journal neuropsychology he says the lefthanders brain is wired slightly differently to the righthanders as it tends to be more symmetrical with larger and perhaps faster connections between hemispheres the research found that on average those with faster connections were more efficient at performing tasks that require processing in two hemispheres typically we tend to use more our two hemispheres together when tasks are very fast or very hard and one hemisphere does not have enough resources to cope cherbuin says examples might be dealing with multiple stimuli that are presented very briefly or tasks which require interpretation of a lot of information such as talking while driving in heavy traffic piloting a jet fighter or playing fast computer games as our brain ages we lose processing resources in the two hemispheres but lefthanders may be able to cope better because the sharing of resource across their hemispheres is more efficient the computer tests in right and lefthanders measured how fast information transferred between hemispheres by hitting a button to indicate whether a light flash was left or right of a dot another test to match letters found lefthanders performed better when letters flashed on both sides of the dot requiring collaboration across hemispheres righthanders did better when letters were on the same side of the dot making them more efficient at single hemisphere processing cherbuin a righthander says the of people who are lefthanded adjust to our righthanded world by using their right hand more superimposing copy number profiles of different human genomes shows each chromosome has distinctive pattern of dna gains shown in green and losses red yellow areas show where there is no difference new investigations into the code for life suggest the assumption that humans are genetically almost identical is wide of the mark and the implications could be resounding current thinking inspired by the results five years ago from the human genome project is that the billion humans alive today are similiar when it comes to genetic content and identity but research published today in the journal nature suggests we are genetically more diverse the repercussions could be farreaching for medical diagnosis new drugs and the tale of human evolution itself the researchers say until now analysis of the genome has focused overwhelmingly on comparing differences or polymorphisms in the patterns of single letters in the chemical code for making and sustaining human life but an international consortium of scientists has taken a different tack and believes it has uncovered a complex higherorder variation in the code this better explains why some individuals are vulnerable to certain diseases and respond well to specific drugs while others swiftly fall sick or never respond to treatment the authors believe their focus has been to dig out deletions or duplications of code among relatively long sequences of individual dna and then compare these socalled copy number variations cnvs across a range of volunteers of different ancestry the researchers were astonished to locate cnvs in nearly genes or around one eighth of the human genetic code each one of us has a unique pattern of gains and losses of complete sections of dna says dr matthew hurles of the uks wellcome trust sanger institute one of the projects partners one of the real surprises of these results was just how much of our dna varies in copy number we estimate this to be at least of the genome the copy number variation that researchers had seen before was simply the tip of the iceberg while the bulk lay submerged undetected we now appreciate the immense contribution of this phenomenon to genetic differences between individuals some of the missing or duplicated stretches are very long suggesting that like backroom switches in a protein factory cnvs must have a big impact on gene expression genetic diseases nearly of genes that are known to be related to disease have cnvs the group found these include genes involved in rare genetic disorders such as digeorge williamsbeuren and praderwilli syndromes and those linked with schizophrenia cataracts spinal muscular atrophy and atherosclerosis but kidney disease parkinsons alzheimers and vulnerability to malaria and hiv which recent research has blamed on singleletter variations in the gene code may also well be rooted in cnvs the scientists believe the stage is set for global studies to explore anew the clinical significance of human variation say professor huntington willard and dr kevin shianna of the institute for genome sciences and policy at duke university in north carolina in a review of the research how about evolution evolution is another area that will come under new scrutiny the out of africa scenario by which homo sapiens emerged from east africa and spread around the globe will not be challenged though our origins are so recent that the vast majority of cnvs around was found to be shared among the people who volunteered blood as samples for the study these individuals included japanese people from tokyo han chinese from beijing yoruba from nigeria and americans of northern and western european ancestry all the same there are widespread differences in cnvs according to the three geographical origins of the samples this implies that over the past years or so subtle variants have arisen in the genome to allow different populations of humans adapt to their different environments according to scientists at wellcome trust sanger the research is based on two technical advances one in faster accurate sequencing of dna and the other in a powerful software programme to spot the cnvs the first supernova ringed on the right in the image was detected in june and the second supernova on the left in november the central bright spot is the galaxy core and the bright object to the far left like an earring is a foreground star stars are blowing themselves to smithereens more often than usual in galaxy ngc astronomers have stumbled across two supernovae letting loose there just months apart in addition to two previous megablasts in the past years that makes the rate of exploding stars in ngc many times higher than any other known galaxy the nasa swift satellite observatory detected the recent twin supernovae on june and november of this year in the images the supernovae are visible on either side of the bright galaxy centre it is actually very puzzling says professor neil gehrels a swift investigator at nasas goddard space flight center thats the most supernovae there have ever been in such a short time a more typical rate is around one a century in a given galaxy so what makes ngc different not a lot at least so far as researchers can tell its a large elliptical galaxy about million lightyears away believed to have recently collided and merged with a spiral galaxy which may have something to do with the accelerated rate of supernovae or not galactic mergers are believed to stir up cosmic dust in a way that can create supermassive stars the sort that eventually explode as supernovae but the supernovae in ngc have the spectral fingerprints of type a supernovae which begin as small dying white dwarf stars rather than supermassive ones theres no reason to believe that a galactic merger would create a larger number of white dwarfs than normal so the mystery continues baby boomers another possible explanation is that there are an inordinate number of white dwarfs in ngc which are the corpses of an extraordinary baby boom of stars in ngc if thats the case a surge of white dwarftriggered supernovae would be expected when all the boomer generation stars reach a similar age on the other hand it could just be chance of the thousands of observable galaxies odds are in favour of an occasional random clustering of supernovae in one galaxy says john nousek a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at pennsylvania state university this sort of thing is more of a cosmic coincidence than a cosmic rosetta stone says nousek he and graduate student peter brown have been hard at work monitoring and trying to make sense of the double explosions the exact mechanism is not well understood says gehrels this is a fairly hot topic silicon has been converted into a superconductor but at very low temperatures if this could be reproduced at room temperatures then we could build superefficient computer circuit boards scientists say they have treated silicon the material of choice for semiconductors so that it paradoxically becomes a superconductor a material that offers no resistance this potentially has huge uses in the efficient transfer of energy whether thats on a large scale like electronic cables or on a smaller scale like in a computer chip but superconductivity in the treated silicon occurs only at degk or degc above absolute zero this means the novel material has no practical use and is only of theoretical interest right now dr etienne bustarret of frances national centre for scientific research cnrs in grenoble and colleagues converted the silicon by doping it with high levels of boron using a pulsed laser at normal pressure they publish their research today in the journal nature alongside a commentary that describes the findings as a breakthrough superconductivity has been found in only a number of materials which at very cold temperatures allow electricity to flow through them without offering any resistance or losing some of the energy as heat scientific but also industrial interest in superconductors is huge as superconductive cable and dynamos would be many times more energyefficient than traditional copper and other conductors in addition superconductor computers could be many times faster than todays their semiconductors would not be hampered by heat one of the biggest problems facing designers today who are tasked with crowding ever more circuits onto a chip exotic oxides cooled by liquid nitrogen have provided the best transition temperatures to superconductivity with temperatures as high as degk stripes on the shoulder of this basketball jersey light up for each foul the player commits an australian researcher has developed a sports jersey that lights up to show players goals or fouls and how much time they have left to play the jersey is called teamawear and is the brainchild of design computing student mitchell page of the university of sydney in fastscoring games like basketball it can be quite hard to keep uptodate with constantly changing statistics that help you understand whats going on says page while some information is posted on the scoreboard this can be difficult to look at during the game page decided that displaying information on players jerseys would be a good idea because these are at the centre of the game everyones focus is directed towards them he says and the jerseys could display realtime information on individual players that is generally not publicly available page developed a basketball jersey with displays made out of electroluminescent panels that light up when electricity flow through them these are connected by conductive thread woven into the jersey a microcontroller communicates via a wireless connection to a computer at the bench where someone can input the detailed information as required there are four stripes over the jerseys shoulder that light up as the number of fouls increase and three bars on the side of the jersey each representing goals two bars on the front of the jersey warn the player when they are nearly out of time one warns when the game is nearly up and the other warns when they need to shoot without incurring a penalty and panels on the back mainly for the benefit of the spectators light up to show the winning side page says when players tested the jerseys they found they were comfortable to wear and improved play by giving them immediate access to more information he says the players found the displays intuitive and easy to understand without being distracting the warning lights on the front were the most important if it was a tight game they could pick up pace but if a player had a lot of fouls they would have to play conservatively players might also choose the displays to choose a highscoring player to pass the ball to page says the jerseys also had an unexpected effect on players psychology athletes said they were more confident when they could see that they had high points or they could see that they were winning he says the coach and referee can also use the displays to choose who to keep on the court without having to refer to the benches and scoreboards as often says page page says while slow sports like golf would probably not benefit from his jersey he hopes the idea can be applied to other team activities he says it might be useful for emergency service personnel working in noisy chaotic environments where verbal communication is difficult teams of people with hearing disabilities debaters and possibly even orchestra members might also benefit from the technology says page wild emmer wheat shown here is more nutritious than some types of domestic wheat so scientists have crossbred new and old strains to improve levels of protein zinc and iron scientists have found a way to boost wheats nutrient content by reintroducing a gene that was lost over the years as the wild plant was domesticated writing in the journal science the researchers say they used conventional breeding methods to bring the gene into cultivated wheat varieties enhancing their protein zinc and iron value the gene which professor jorge dubcovsky from the university of california davis and colleagues have identified has became nonfunctional for unknown reasons over the years this occurred as humans cultivated the wild wheat known as wild emmer wheat triticum turgidum ssp dicoccoides wheat represents one of the major crops feeding people worldwide providing about of all calories consumed the world health organization says that upward of billion people get too little zinc and iron in their diet and more than million children under the age of lack adequate protein we really can produce wheat with more protein and more zinc and iron dubcovsky says so if that is grown in a developing country or is used as food aid it will really provide more of those needed things in places where its necessary same taste in making the wheat more nutritious the researchers did not change how it tastes dubcovsky says were not changing the composition or anything very dramatic in the grain he says i dont think a simple step like this will solve hunger in the world im not that naive but i think its heading in the right direction dubcovsky says the gene made the grain mature more quickly while also boosting its protein and micronutrient content by in the pasta and bread wheat varieties with which the researchers worked what this gene does is it uses better what is in the plant already so rather than leave the protein and the zinc and iron in the straw weve moved a little bit more into the grain dubcovsky says the wheat varieties bred by the scientists are not genetically modified which could help them become accepted commercially they say we didnt do it by genetic modification the normal wheat crosses perfectly well with the wild wheat so we just crossed it after normal breeding dubcovsky says the research team includes scientists from the us department of agriculture and the university of haifa in israel dubcovsky heads a consortium of public wheatbreeding programs called the wheat coordinated agricultural project annual wheat production is estimated at million tonnes of grain worldwide the mass extinction known as the great dying million years ago had profound and lasting effects on marine life the upper part of the image represents life before the mass extinction the lower part afterwards about of the earths marine species and of its land species were wiped out during a mass extinction about million years ago according to australian and us researchers this event which occurred at the end of the permian age and is known as the great dying fundamentally changed which species survived in the worlds oceans and scientists at james cook university in townsville queensland and the field museum in chicago warn that modern humaninduced changes to the ecosystem could have a similar impact the researchers report in todays issue of the journal science how they came across the culling of species while examining figures on the numbers of marine life forms in communities over the past million years simple species that did not move or search for food were largely wiped out they conclude more complex life forms such as crabs and snails that went looking for food took over the biological devastation occurred when the earth was believed to have had only one continent surrounded by a single ocean the researchers did not go into what caused the mass extinction but using a new palaeobiology database they gave what they say are the most exhaustive details ever assembled of its effect ecologically simple species such as stationary shells and other forms that filtered food out of the water were replaced by complex communities mobile species such as crabs and clams we think these are the first analyses of this type at this large scale says dr peter wagner associate curator of fossil invertebrates at the field museum and lead author of the study who worked with dr matthew kosnik of james cook university they show that the endpermian mass extinction permanently altered not just taxonomic diversity but also the prevailing marine ecosystem structure wagner says the results of the study could provide a warning on how we treat the ecosystem now the experts say studies by modern marine ecologists suggest that humans are reducing certain marine ecosystems to something reminiscent of million years ago prior to the explosion of animal diversity wagner says the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs couldnt manage that a fraction of the amber collected so far from the beaches of northern australia huge chunks of amber containing the remnants of ancient rainforests have been found along beaches in far north queensland the first amber fossils to be found in australia the amber pieces some as big as a football contain flies beetles spiders flowers fungi moss fern spores and pollen as well as bubbles of gas and water from the time the researchers say the fossils are at least million years old they say possibly much older fisherman dale wicks and partner beth norris discovered the amber while taking evening walks along the beach on the cape york peninsula says university of new south wales palaeontologist henk godthelp it turns out that it was the very first discovery of true amber in australia says godthelp who was invited to analyse the fossils and reported the find at the riversleigh society meeting in sydney this week while amberlike substances such as copal and coal resin are found in australia noone had found true amber he says godthelp who studies the evolution of rainforests says the fossilised resin is most likely from kauri pine which grows in rainforests he says amber is very good at preserving living creatures trapped inside it because it stops the air from getting to them and also contains chemicals that act as preservatives anything trapped inside it he says will give a unique picture of ancient rainforests this includes insects which come from the rainforest canopy and bubbles of water or gas which he says could provide clues about past climates nearly one in five of the amber pieces found contain fossils or bubbles of water or gas says godthelp by world standards thats remarkably high how old godthelp says he doesnt know how old the amber is yet but it would be at least million years old possibly much older we think its probably tertiary he says polonium interferes with the bodys ability to repair itself polonium the highly toxic radioactive isotope found in the body of poisoned former russian spy alexander litvinenko is a very rare exotic material that is difficult to obtain scientists say the uks health protection agency says litvinenko who died last week in a london hospital had a significant amount of the radioactive isotope in his body but how it got there and where it came from is a mystery radiation and chemistry experts say largescale equipment such as a nuclear reactor would be needed to produce sufficient amounts
